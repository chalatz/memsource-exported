**Demand for Translation Services from New Buyers **-** **Donald A. DePalma, Founder at [Common Sense Advisory](http://www.commonsenseadvisory.com/)

While most LSPs strive to land work from localization departments with big budgets and predictable volumes of large projects, the reality of today’s market is different. Most of the demand comes from smaller jobs, many from first-time in business or customer-facing functions like marketing, social engagement, or business intelligence. The presentation at Memsource User Meetup describes this **new category of demand**, discusses **changes in the behavior of traditional buying communities**, and recommends **how LSPs should treat the relationships that evolve with both these new and old buyers**.
