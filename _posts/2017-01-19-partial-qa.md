Partial QA gives users freedom to run QA checks they currently need and leave the rest of the checks for later. The individual QA checks can be selected/deselected after clicking on the downwards pointing arrow next to <strong>Run</strong> on the QA pane. Before setting the file as completed, it will be necessary to run the full QA with all project default checks.
