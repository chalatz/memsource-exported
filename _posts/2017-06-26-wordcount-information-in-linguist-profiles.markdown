A new column has been added to the profile pages of Linguists in order to provide a better overview for the Project Managers.

It is now possible to not only see the number of jobs assigned to the given Linguist, but also a RAW wordcount for each of the given document.

This way it will be easier for Project Managers to determine what is the workload currently assigned to each of the Linguist and it can help streamline the communication and assignment of tasks in Memsource.
