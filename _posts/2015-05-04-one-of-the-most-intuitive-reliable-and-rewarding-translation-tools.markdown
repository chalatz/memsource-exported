"Being a full-time freelance translator, I worked with many CAT tools in the past, so when I subscribed to Memsource, I made an informed decision. It is by far one of the most intuitive, reliable, and rewarding translation tools I have ever come across, and it is worth every single cent I pay for it. Memsource supports many formats, it is easy to use, and it saves me so much time and money!<!-- more -->

I want you to know that I mean every single word of it, because Memsource has changed what I used to think about translation tools. It is simply amazing. When one of the managers called me 2.5 years ago after I first registered, I was skeptical, but now I couldnâ€™t live without it".
