Memsource held its first user meetup of 2016 on March 20, in New York, on the pre-conference day of the GALA congress. The user meetup saw the participation of over 80 people, who networked with one another and exchanged contacts for future collaboration on multilingual projects.

The event started with a presentation by Donald A. DePalma from Common Sense Advisory. In his talk, Dr. DePalma described the new requirements set by new buyers of translation services. He also discussed changes in the behavior of traditional buying communities, and recommended how LSPs should treat the relationships that evolve with both these new and old buyers.

The presentation was followed by a discussion with the attendees and a panel of translation buyers and vendors. Among the panelists were Joanna Madetko-Niedbała (Digital Project Manager at Danfoss), Alessandra Binazzi (Localization Manager at Pinnacle Sports) and Patricia Borges (Manager, Translation and Brand Assurance at FM Global).

Josef Kubovsky, Head of Sales at Memsource, provided an outline of the new Memsource Cloud features (e.g. Automation Widget, Shared Project functionality and Business Analytics) as well as a sneak preview of what&#8217;s on the Memsource development roadmap.

We received great feedback from all the attendees and we are already hard at work planning a new event. Stay tuned!
