Two leading providers of translation technology, [XTRF Management Systems](http://www.xtrf.eu/) and [MemSource](http://www.memsource.com/) have announced API-driven integration between their core products, XTRF and Memsource Cloud. XTRF is a translation management platform and Memsource Cloud is a web-based translation environment or CAT tool.<!-- more -->

This integration takes the currently available file-based integration to a new level. The API-based integration between Memsource and XTRF will help translation companies and corporate language departments run their translation and localization projects in a single seamless workflow between the two systems.

"The integration that we are announcing is a powerful solution for automating translation projects in server-based and as well as cloud-based environments. The integration between XTRF and Memsource delivers a comprehensive and cost-effective framework for optimizing our clients’ project performance," said Andrzej Nedoma, Managing Director and founder of XTRF Management Systems.

Memsource CEO David Canek adds: "This integration removes many repetitive tasks that project managers used to have to duplicate in their translation management application as well as their CAT tool. Creating projects, selecting translation memories, assigning linguists, launching word count analyses and producing quotes – all of this and much more has been fully automated between the two systems."

Contact XTRF or Memsource for further details about the integration, which will become available during November 2013.
