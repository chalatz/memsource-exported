Last week I held a webinar, titled "[Making Machine Translation Part of Your Everyday Workflow](/free-webinar-make-machine-translation-part-of-your-workflow/)". The webinar has been [recorded and posted on YouTube](http://youtu.be/NED7zGAmTU0). It has been attended by over 90 people (mainly localization specialists working for translation agencies or translation buyers).<!-- more -->

We ran three polling questions during the webinar and I would like to share the results here beacuse they are just very interesting. Although not fully representative, they provide a picture of where we are with machine translation today in the translation industry: Still a long way to go as one would expect.

To experience the way Memsource Cloud integrates machine translation into the everyday translation workflow, [take a free trial](http://www.memsource.com/pricing/). Or read about our [post-editing analysis](http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Post-editing_Analysis) that provides insight into machine translation quality and usage at a segment level.

**Question 1  (only 4% use MT for all of their translation projects)**

**Question 3 (over 80% of MT users have no reliable way of measuring MT quality)**
