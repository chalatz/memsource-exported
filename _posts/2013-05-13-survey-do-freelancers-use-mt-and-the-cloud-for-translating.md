Memsource and [ProZ.com](http://www.proz.com/) have recently hosted a webinar that revealed some interesting facts about freelancers and technology. Although the group, with 190 registrants (and a little bit less than half that attended), cannot be viewed as representative for the freelancer community, we still got some interesting numbers. We have set up 3 polls, two of which were related to machine translation and one of which was related to cloud translation technology.<!--more-->

And we got these results:

[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1618" title="frequently_use_mt" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/frequently_use_mt2-300x182.png" alt="" width="300" height="182" />](/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/frequently_use_mt2.png)

I bet that currently there are more freelancers than translation companies that routinely use MT.

Sometimes freelancers are asked to use MT by their clients and so it is not their choice to use MT in this case.

[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1621" title="cloud-experience" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/cloud-experience-300x183.png" alt="" width="300" height="183" />](/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/cloud-experience.png)

Still a LOT of potential for translation cloud technology&#8230;
