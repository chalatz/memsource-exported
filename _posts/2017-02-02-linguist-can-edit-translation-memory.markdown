We have added a new option to our Linguist User Settings: Edit translations in Translation Memory (TM).

Admins and Project managers can now allow a Linguist to search TM on the Cloud and edit the records in the Translation Memory. This is similar to the "Terminologist" option which has been renamed to "Edit all terms in TB".

Linguists can log into their Linguist Portal, open the Project page and and click on the Translation Memory assigned to the project. They can search TM, edit the text, and delete the segment or the whole translation unit the same way Project Managers can.



 	
  * Only a "Write" TM is open for editing, "Read" TMs are for search only.

 	
  * All languages in writable TM will be available for search and editing.

 	
  * Import, Export and Align functions are **not** permitted for Linguists.
