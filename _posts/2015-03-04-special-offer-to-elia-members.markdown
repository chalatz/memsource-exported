[![](/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/elia-memsource.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/elia-memsource.jpg)We're happy to announce that Memsource has joined the European Language Industry Association, or Elia.  Together with the association we've designed a special offer to Elia members: a 60-day extended trial and online training to test Memsource's powerful collaboration features for translation companies.<!-- more -->



MLVs, SLVs and end clients can work in a single, connected environment in Memsource Cloud. Real-time TM updates, terminology and job progress are shared across the entire team, while other information, including names of translators, is kept strictly private. This approach provides a very powerful feature set for MLVs and SLVs looking to streamline their translation process. Elia members can benefit from an extended [60-day free trial and 1-hour online training](http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Memsource_Cloud_User_Manual#Shared_Projects_Introduction) in Shared Jobs and Instant Quotes features. To use this offer, contact Josef at [jk@memsource.com](mailto:jk@memsource.com).



	
  * If you are an MLV, take a look at how Moravia, Semantix and Honyaku Center use Memsource to empower workflow with SLVs and freelancers.

	
  * If you are an SLV, sign-up for your own Memsource Cloud account, MLVs will be more likely to give you translation work if you can connect to their systems.





Elia, the European Language Industry Association, brings together translation, localization and interpreting companies that do business in Europe. Born from six European LSPs, today Elia has more than 200 members distributed all over the world.  The association provides its members with tools and opportunities to improve their businesses, such as training and networking events, resources for business development, and joint marketing efforts.
