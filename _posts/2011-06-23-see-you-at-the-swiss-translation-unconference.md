The Swiss Translation Unconference is starting tomorrow in NeuchÃ¢tel and Memsource will be present there. Joseph and I Â (David) are attending.

It will be our first unconference, so we are excited to see how it goes.Joseph, our sales guy, has already been instructed not to try to sell anything to anybody this time ðŸ™‚<!--more-->

See you there hopefully!
