### **[![](/uploads/2017/10/aem6.png)](/uploads/2017/10/aem6.png)**Plugin for Adobe Experience Manager


The Memsource Translation Plugin for Adobe Experience Manager enables managers to efficiently produce global multilingual web and mobile content to speak to local markets around the world.

Within the AEM 6.2 platform, users can choose content for translation, request a Scope from the preferred Vendor, select a due date, and then send directly to Memsource for translation with a single click. Statuses will change in AEM as the project in Memsource progresses through the translation process. Users will receive an automated email notification when the translation is ready for approval or revision.

The plugin for AEM is available by [contacting the Sales team](https://www.memsource.com/contact-sales/) and is coming soon to the AEM Marketplace. Learn more about setting up the AEM Plugin in our [Support Center](https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003461031-How-to-set-up-and-use-Memsource-Translation-Plugin-for-AEM) and [documentation](https://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Adobe_experience_manager_plugin).


### **[![](/uploads/2017/10/marketo_logo-981x1024.png)](/uploads/2017/10/marketo_logo.png)**Marketo Connector


The Marketo Connector allows Memsource users with Ultimate and Unlimited editions to pull emails, files, landing pages, and forms directly into Memsource for translation and pushes the translated content back into the Marketo system. Users can select content to be pulled for translation either manually or automatically.

### **[![](/uploads/2017/10/Photoshop-logo.png)](/uploads/2017/10/Photoshop-logo.png)**Translating Photoshop Files


Adobe Photoshop .psd files can be imported, automatically recognized, and processed as a supported file format. This includes support for both hidden and locked layers. 

P.S. Want to also translate [PDF](https://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/PDF) and [InDesign](https://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Adobe_InDesign) files? Memsource has solutions for both of those as well.
