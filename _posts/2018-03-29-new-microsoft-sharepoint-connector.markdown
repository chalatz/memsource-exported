We have introduced a connector for Microsoft SharePoint. SharePoint is a browser-based collaboration and document management platform. <!-- more -->

With the SharePoint Connector, you can use Memsource to translate Microsoft Word, Excel and Powerpoint documents created in SharePoint. You can also translate files in other formats which have been uploaded to SharePoint. See the list of [supported file formats](https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000446911-Supported-File-Formats) (.zip files are not supported). 

This connector is available for our Ultimate and Enterprise users.

Learn more about SharePoint on [Microsoft’s dedicated SharePoint page](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/what-is-sharepoint-97b915e6-651b-43b2-827d-fb25777f446f).

To find out how to set up and use the Microsoft SharePoint connector with Memsource, see [this Help Center article](https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003948452#Microsoft_SharePoint).
