The first stage of the **Language Quality Assurance (LQA)** feature has been introduced in both Memsource Editors as part of Conversations. The feature allows evaluating the quality of translation through error categories (such as accuracy, fluency, and terminology, etc.) and severity (neutral, minor, major, and critical).

**Admins** of the account can configure **Error categories and subcategories** together with **Severities** in **LQA Settings** under Setup.

How to enable LQA in Memsource? Open an existing workflow step or create a new one (navigate to Setup &#8211; Workflow Steps) and simply select the **Enable LQA **checkbox.  Any linguist assigned to such workflow will be able to perform LQA in both Memsource Editors.

The feature is available to Ultimate and BIZ Ultimate editions.
