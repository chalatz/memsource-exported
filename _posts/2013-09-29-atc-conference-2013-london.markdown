Memsource customer, Asset Language Management has presented a remarkable case study:

**"Deploying cloud translation technology for a market leading client"**

The presenters, Lisa Williams and Rachel Wilks of ALM, have explained how the deployment of Memsource Cloud has completely changed the way they work with their major client:

After assessing the available options, ALM decided to deploy a cloud-based translation technology._"
