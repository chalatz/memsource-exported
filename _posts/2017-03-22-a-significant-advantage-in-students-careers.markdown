On behalf of the trainers at the Interpreting and Translation Department (Herzen State Pedagogical University of Russia, Saint-Petersburg), I would like to extend my sincerest thanks and appreciation to the Memsource team for enabling us to introduce their Academic Edition in our curriculum in 2017.

Working with Memsource is very important for our students – future translators – who are trained in our Bachelor's and Master's Programs. By using Memsource, they gain invaluable experience and job-specific skills, including understanding in practice the importance of building extensive Translation Memories and Termbases.

Without any doubt, once they graduate, our students will have a significant advantage in their careers thanks to their technology knowledge and skills acquired through Memsource.
