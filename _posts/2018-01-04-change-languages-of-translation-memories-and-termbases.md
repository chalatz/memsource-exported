Project Managers can now change the languages ofÂ translation memories (TMs) and termbases (TBs) that are empty and not attached to any projects.

<!--more-->

Previously, if Project Managers wanted to edit the source and target languages of an empty TM or TB they would need to delete the incorrect TM or TB and create a new one which would have a new identification number. Now, even when the source or target language of a TM or TB is edited, the identification number remains the same.
