We have released Memsource Editor 1.78 today. This is a minor release and includes just a few improvements:<!--more-->

  * Memsource Editor now permanently remembers the selected quotation option 
      * Previously it only remembered a selected quotation option until it was restarted

  * Linguists are allowed to confirm locked segments if they were already confirmed in a previous [workflow step](http://support.memsource.com/topic/can-you-explain-what-workflow-is-good-for-and-how-it-works) 
      * Previously linguist users were not able to confirm these locked segments and so it had to be done by a project manager
  * Â Source and target character count for a selected segment is now displayed in the status bar 
      * Please note that this new segment character count includes spaces while the general character count (for the entire MXLIFF file) does not include spaces
      * Useful for localization projects
