<span style="font-weight: 400;">Users can now turn off auto-propagation of repetitions in both Memsource Desktop Editor and Memsource Web Editor.</span>

<!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Previously, if there were repetitions in the source text, the translation of those repetitions was automatically input into the corresponding target segments. This could cause issues for users if the context was different. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, Admins and Project Managers can decide whether or not to enable auto-propagation of repetitions. They will also be able to select whether Linguist users can enable or disable auto-propagation of repetitions from within the Editors. By default, auto-propagation of repetitions is enabled. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To find out more information about using this new option, see </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">our Help Center</span>](https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003632431-Repetitions)<span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>
