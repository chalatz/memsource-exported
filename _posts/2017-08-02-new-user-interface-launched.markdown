The new look is the first step in a multi-phase redesign of the Memsource Cloud user interface. The new look has been designed to optimize the user’s experience in the platform. Additional changes will be rolled out over the coming months.

The first round of UI changes includes the following:



 	
  * a new color scheme, with dark and light options

 	
  * the top navigation of Projects, Translation Memories, and Term Bases has been relocated to the left-hand menu

 	
  * a gear icon has been added in the top right navigation now containing items from the Useful Links and Setup menus
