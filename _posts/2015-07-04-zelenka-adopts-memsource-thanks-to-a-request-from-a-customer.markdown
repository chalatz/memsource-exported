"We’ve added Memsource to our portfolio of CAT tools thanks to a request from one of our highly respected clients. <!-- more -->We really like its cloud integration, its new features, and how generally user-friendly it is. It supports all the standard formats, and the best thing about it is that the the agency buys the license and can then lend it to the translators who either work online or download a simple editor. This software is especially popular abroad, even though it was developed in the Czech Republic".



Zelenka is a family-owned regional language vendor based in Central Europe. They have been in the business for more than 25 years. Zelenka utilizes a network of over 3000 translators and technology infrastructure that comprises a selection of 6 CAT-tools including Memsource.
