[![insert_symbols](http://www.memsource.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Insert_symbols.png)](http://www.memsource.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Insert_symbols.png)Starting from desktop [Memsource Editor version 6.201.6](http://www.memsource.com/download/) it is possible to insert symbols and special characters into translation. The character map will open when pressing **Ctrl + Shift + L** or navigating to **Edit → Insert Symbol → More Symbols**. Subsets are supported for easier and quicker navigation through different categories of symbols, such as Mathematical Operators, Currency Symbols, Greek letters etc.




The feature will be implemented in the Web editor in the coming weeks.
