**In which language(s) will you give Memsource training?** French, English, Spanish, Catalan.

**What activities are you developing &#8211; or have developed &#8211; as Memsource Certified Trainer?** I haven&#8217;t decided yet.

**What kind of audience do you plan to train/are you training?** Independant translators and project managers.

**What do you like most about Memsource?** It&#8217;s a clear tool, with good ergonomics and server backup while using a light desktop software. Above all: It has a responsive user support. Also, the interface is simple and does not divert the attention from the text itself.
