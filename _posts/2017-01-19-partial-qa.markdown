[![partial_qa](http://www.memsource.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Partial_QA.png)](http://www.memsource.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Partial_QA.png)Up until now when users needed to check a file in progress, they had to run the full QA which could give them lots of false positives (e.g. warnings for unconfirmed segments, empty target etc.). Partial QA gives users freedom to run QA checks they currently need and leave the rest of the checks for later. The individual QA checks can be selected/deselected after clicking on the downwards pointing arrow next to **Run** on the QA pane. Before setting the file as completed, it will be necessary to run the full QA with all project default checks.




The feature is currently implemented in desktop [Memsource Editor 6.201.6](http://www.memsource.com/download/) and will be added to Web editor in the coming weeks.
