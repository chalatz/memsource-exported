The [kick-off webinar](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6kK67dNFVE) took place on **Thursday, June 21** and was Â hosted by the Globalization and Localization Association.

Presenters David Canek, CEO of Memsource Technologies, and Joergen Danielsen, Owner and Managing Director of EULE Lokalisierung GmbH, provided webinar attendees with an **[MT post-editing starter kit](http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/The_MT_Post-editing_Experiment#The_Starter_Kit)** that includes the necessary advice to easily get started on MT post-editing with zero financial costs.

Webinar attendees will run their own MT post-editing pilots and are invited to attend a follow-up webinar in September where results will be summarized, examined, and discussed.
