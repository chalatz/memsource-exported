<span style="font-weight: 400;">Originally, this information was only available in the tool tip that appears when a user hovers over the NT match. The position of this information is outlined in the screenshot.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">An NT match can either be rule-based or AI-based. If an NT match is rule-based that means our system has recognized the segment as matching a certain rule. Rule-based NT matches are typically numbers or combinations of characters which aren&#8217;t recognized as words. If a match is AI-based it means that the segment matches our AI model. The AI model can identify more types of NTs.</span>
