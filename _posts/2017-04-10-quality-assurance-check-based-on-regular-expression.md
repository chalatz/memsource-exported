Memsource Cloud now offers the option to define the Quality Assurance check based on the inserted Regular Expression.

In the Quality Assurance settings, users can define the REGEXP either for Source or Target portion of the text as well as the desired Description (which will serve as a warning in the QA if the problem is identified).

These settings can be defined for the entire account (underÂ **SETUP**) or per Project (in the **Project settings**).
