&#8220;In 2013 Aston University added Memsource to the CAT tools we use for the teaching of translation students. The Memsource Academic edition was easy to arrange, was provided quickly and is free of charge.<!--more-->

We have used it in a basic introduction to CAT tools and as a tool for students to manage and complete team translation projects. The fact that Memsource is cloud-based has two major benefits:  (a) liaison with local IT support is not required; (b) student use is not restricted to on-site.

As a teacher, there is an overhead in setting up student accounts and permissions, but this is preferable to arranging local installation.

The Memsource server has been reliable. When we started using Memsource the web editor was still in beta, but despite a few browser-dependent reliability issues, students chose to use it instead of the Memsource client-side editor.

From a learning and teaching perspective, a possible negative is the fact that Memsource hides students from some of the complexities of file-handling involved in the use of client-side CAT tools. However, I personally find the ease of use an educational benefit!

I thank Memsource for providing this software and their speedy response to the (very few) queries I have had. I recommend the Memsource Academic edition to other universities aiming to introduce its translation students to a range of software.&#8221;
