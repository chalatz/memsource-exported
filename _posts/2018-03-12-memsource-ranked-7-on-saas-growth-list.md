Memsource has been ranked the 7th fastest growing SaaS company and 4th fastest in Europe by the <a href="http://saas1000.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SaaS 1000: Top SaaS Companies</a> list.<!--more-->

The list requires a minimum of 40 employees and the algorithm calculates growth based on the number of employees added over the previous six months.

Memsource, which provides an AI-powered translation management system for the localization supply chain, is headquartered in Prague and has offices in Japan and the United States with employees from 14 nationalities. It grew by nearly 58% during the ranking period and has since added an additional 13 employees for a total of 84 at the time of the announcement.

With the growth, several new teams were formed with the goal of expanding business services and generating innovation, such as the <a href="https://www.memsource.com/blog/2018/01/09/memsource-releasing-first-feature-powered-by-artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Artificial Intelligence</a> team, the Quality Assurance team, and the Solutions Architect team.

“2017 was an exciting year for Memsource,” says CEO David Canek. “We were able to welcome some really talented people to the company who are excited to enhance the platform and add new features and services for our customers in the localization industry. We’re looking forward to the next 6 months and beyond.”
