<span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft is changing their Collaborative Translation functions due to a European privacy law, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which is taking effect from May 2018. The functions will be deprecated and will become read-only on February 1, 2018. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, we have had to remove calls sending corrections (feedback) to Microsoft Translator Hub engines from our code. The option <strong>Send feedback</strong> is no longer available when creating a new Microsoft Translator Hub engine or editing an existing one. Read <a href="https://cognitive.uservoice.com/knowledgebase/articles/1828936-changes-to-the-collaborative-translation-functions">Microsoft’s official announcement</a> about changes to the Collaborative Translation functions. </span>
