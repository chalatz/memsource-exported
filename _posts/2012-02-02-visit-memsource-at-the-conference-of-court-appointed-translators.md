Memsource sponsors the International Conference of the Chamber of Court Appointed Interpreters and Translators of the Czech Republic, held on the occasion of the Chamber&#8217;s 15th anniversary.

Memsource CEO, David Canek, will hold a speech on &#8220;Machine Translation: Benefits and Pitfalls&#8221; and we will also have a booth there where we will show off Memsource Cloud and Memsource Editor, with Josef Kubovsky, our Business Development Manager at the forefront.<!--more-->
