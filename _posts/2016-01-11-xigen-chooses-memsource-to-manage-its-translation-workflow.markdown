**Xigen** is a creative digital agency based in Bedford, United Kingdom, specializing in the creation and development of** high quality e-commerce websites**. This multi-skilled production agency also offers translation services to its customers to help them break into new markets and engage with an audience worldwide. 

After having tried few different CAT tools, Xigen has chosen the Memsource platform to manage the translation workflow of its multilingual digital projects, among other things, because of the numerous **collaborative features** provided by our technology and the great **technical support** offered by our team. 

“_As a digital agency, we are always looking to the future and feel that cloud technology is going to play a big part in it. It means that the whole translation team can work collaboratively online with the ability to share translation memories and update them in real time_.”
