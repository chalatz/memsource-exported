When a company first deploys and starts using UTMA, they are usually surprised by the number of inconsistencies within their content that get surfaced. In the context of source code, for instance, one of our clients realized they had 11 ways of saying “Please wait” in their software.<!--more-->

Here they are:

wait…
  
Wait…
  
Wait
  
Please wait…
  
Please Wait…
  
Please wait.
  
Please wait …
  
Please Wait …
  
Please wait …
  
Please Wait
  
… Please wait …

Had the developers writing the source code (and the text and error messages in it) deployed UTMA, they could have used just a single “Please wait” and substantial resources would have been saved during the localization process.

This particular company localized their software in 10 languages and so had to translate 17 words into 10 languages in vain just because of this inefficiency. Multiply this by the rate that a translation provider charges per word and you may arrive in the neighborhood of $25  just for this single case ($0.15\*17\*10).
