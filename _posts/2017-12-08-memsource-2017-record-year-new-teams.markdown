Just like each year before it, 2017 has been a record-setting year for Memsource.<!-- more -->

In October, Memsource processed 2.6 billion words in a single month, setting an all-time record. Then, in November, we set a new record with 2.8 billion words.



[![](/uploads/2017/12/Words-Processed-Nov-2017.png)](/uploads/2017/12/Words-Processed-Nov-2017.png) Insights from Kibana show Memsource Cloud processed over 2.8 billion words in November 2017.


This year, we released several new [CMS connectors](https://www.memsource.com/integrations/) and a [mobile app](https://www.memsource.com/app/), gave the platform a [new design](https://www.memsource.com/blog/2017/08/02/new-user-interface-launched/) for a smoother user experience, and upgraded our APIs to [REST standards](https://www.memsource.com/blog/2017/10/24/introducing-rest-apis-qa-with-the-memsource-api-team/). New analytics dashboards in [projects](https://www.memsource.com/blog/2017/07/20/new-project-dashboard-launches-upcoming-interface-changes/) and on the [homepage](https://www.memsource.com/blog/2017/02/27/new-homepage-analytics-dashboards-to-track-localization/) provide more information to project managers and translation buyers, [client portals](https://www.memsource.com/blog/2017/03/16/client-portals-a-new-customer-focused-solution/) provide easy access for internal and external customers to submit translation jobs, and everyone can better communicate with [conversations](https://www.memsource.com/blog/2017/08/30/increasing-communication-through-conversations/) in the editors. And that barely scratches the surface on our [product updates](https://www.memsource.com/new/).

**But none of this happens on its own.** In 2017, Memsource grew from 45 to 70 employees, increasing across all departments, especially in the development team. Eight more will join in January of 2018, and [we’re still hiring](https://www.memsource.com/careers/). Starting in the new year, we will have employees from 13 countries across three continents who speak 21 different languages.

This growth has meant adding new office space in Prague as well as creating new teams to increase efficiency and internal collaboration and, ultimately, to better serve you - our customers and partners.

Some of the new teams include:



 	
  * A Quality Assurance team for better feature testing

 	
  * A team of Solutions Architects to help create customized technology setups

 	
  * A team devoted to server infrastructure

 	
  * Two teams within the marketing department

 	
  * A team devoted to features that contribute to continuous localization strategies

 	
  * and many more!


We've come a long way since 2011 and still have big plans ahead.


## A Roundtable Webinar with New Team Members


On Wednesday, December 13 at 17:00 CET, we will have a special [year-end webinar with a roundtable discussion](https://register.gotowebinar.com/register/3146012116894640131) highlighting this growth, especially the people behind the scenes that make Memsource happen on a day-to-day basis. I’ll be joined by five Memsource team members, four of whom joined us full-time this year, and we invite you to hear about some new initiatives for 2018 and ask us some questions.
