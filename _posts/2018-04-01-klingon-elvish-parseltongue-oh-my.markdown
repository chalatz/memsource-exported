In the true spirit of Memsource, we strive to go where no translation platform has gone before. This includes our language selection.*<!-- more -->

_*Disclaimer: We’re not 100% sure no one else has these new languages, but it sounded catchy._

Our list of 400+ supported languages is always growing. Our most recent (and undoubtedly most nerdy) additions include favorites from some of the biggest fantasy book and film franchises.

These languages include:
 	
  * Klingon - Star Trek

 	
  * Parseltongue - Harry Potter

 	
  * Dothraki - Game of Thrones

 	
  * Elvish - Lord of the Rings

 	
  * Wookiee - Star Wars

.

_**April Fools!** _We're just kidding. Sort of.

It’s true, we’re not adding MOST of these, but Klingon will actually be available in our supported languages on Tuesday, April 3. **That’s no joke.**

Qapla’! (Success!) Happy Translating!
