Memsource attended the 6th EUATC International Conference in Rome, which took place from 8 to 9 April. We exhibited our translation software and had a number of inspiring conversations there. We were, of course, very happy that the Memsource Translation Server attracted a lot of attention and generated a number of evaluation requests, which we have scheduled for the second half of May, when the new Memsource Translation Server arrives.<!-- more -->

Last but not least, we were very pleased to hear Luigi Muzii, a prominent Italian expert on localization, mention us in his lecture as one of the software companies to keep an eye on in the cloud translation software space.
