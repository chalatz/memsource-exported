Last year we launched our <a href="/memsource-certified-trainer-program/" target="_blank">Memsource Certified Trainers Program</a> and we were overwhelmed  &#8211; and extremely pleased &#8211; by the number of applications received. **Ten participants have already passed the test** and are now officially **Memsource Certified Trainers**. Others will start the training program soon.

For those of you who are still thinking whether to join the program, watch this space: We will announce a new training program in the fall.

As of today, we will start introducing the new certified trainers to the Memsource community. Here is the first interview.

  <strong>Masa Kajiki</strong>, Founder and CEO of <strong><a href="http://www.mktranslationfirm.com/" target="_blank">MK Translation Firm</a></strong>
</p>

**Years of experience in the translation industry**: 15.

**Years of experience as Memsource user**: Since 2011.

**Why did you choose to become Memsource Certified Trainer?** Because I would like to spread Memsource across Japan.

**In which language(s) will you give a Memsource training?** Japanese.

**What activities are you developing &#8211; or have developed &#8211; as Memsource Certified Trainer? **In the past, I held a presentation on Memsource, together with Josef Kubovsky, at the Translation Festival organized by the <a href="http://www.jtf.jp/english/" target="_blank">Japan Translation Federation</a> (JTF) in Tokyo, in 2013 and 2014.

During the first Memsource appearance at the festival, our in-house translator acted as interpreter for David Čaněk’s speech. I also appeared in [one of the Memsource webinars in Japanese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwa8B9xRd-c) and organized a Memsource seminar in Osaka.

In the future, I plan to organize a Memsource seminar in the Western region of Japan.

**What kind of audience do you plan to train/are you training? **I will start by training our in-house staff and our registered freelance translators. In the near future, I will train translation school students.  On request, I will be happy to train corporate clients.

**Which are the most useful Memsource functionalities for your work? **The most useful functionality is the possibility of <a href="http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Memsource_Cloud_User_Manual#Workflow_Steps" target="_blank">creating various workflow steps</a>.

**What do you like most about Memsource? **What I like most is that Memsource is cloud-based, so that data is always up to date.

**Anything else you would like to share with us? **MK Translation Firm is the first agency to adopt Memsource in Japan.  I am probably the first Japanese person to adopt Memsource.
