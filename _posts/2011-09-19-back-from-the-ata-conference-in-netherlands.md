The Dutch Association of Translation Agencies hosted its annual conference in Ede on September 9. Memsource sponsored the event and held a workshop there on increasing LSP productivity through machine translation. The conference was great &#8211; big thanks to the organizers!<!--more-->

Our workshop went also really well, the participants were friendly and had lots of inputs. What was really interesting for me, was to get reminded once again (and not the last time certainly) how hard it is for new technology to make inroads into our industry. I think that&#8217;s why the organizers chose a name for the conference that was quite provocative &#8220;The Future Is Here.&#8221; When asked how many of the 30-40 LSPs at our workshop introduced machine translation into their workflow, no one raised their hand. And not because the people there would be shy&#8230;

Let&#8217;s see next year!
