[XTRF Management Systems](http://www.xtrf.eu/) and [MemSource](http://www.memsource.com/) have announced a roadmap leading to **deep integration** of their products today. The integration will extend the current import of Memsource analysis files in a .csv/.log format and the automatic preparation of quotes based on this data in XTRF.<!--more-->

XTRF Managing Director Andrzej Nedoma comments: “XTRF has seen growing interest in deeper Memsource and XTRF integration in the market. As a result, we have decided to take the current integration that we have with Memsource to the next level and make it available in our next release, scheduled for Q4/2013.”

Memsource CEO David Canek adds: “We are excited to see our relationship with XTRF strengthen. I am positive that this move will create additional benefits for XTRF, Memsource and last but not least the customers of both companies.”
