Memsource Cloud 2.4 was released on 3 September 2012. Read more about the new features below or watch a[ recording of a Memsource webinar](http://youtu.be/bBX8O0FTgXA) that provided an overview of the new features (the 2.4 release includes over 100 improvements and bug fixes).<!-- more -->


## First, an Important UI Change





	
  * Introducing inactive menu buttons:

	
    * Until you select a file in your project, menu buttons (such as Download, Pre-translate, etc.) will be displayed as inactive (since we do not know to which file you want to apply that action). After selecting a file, the buttons will become active, so that you can download, analyze, pre-translate ...  the selected file(s)

## The New Features





	
  * Self-learning capability: Memsource will automatically suggest relevant linguists _(only in the Team edition)_

	
    * When assigning a job to a linguist, Memsource will suggest most relevant linguists automatically, based on the linguist's previous jobs

	
    * The suggestion criteria can also be set and modified manually on the user's detail page




	
  * Linguist users can be assigned [custom roles](http://support.memsource.com/topic/how-to-create-translator-reviewer-and-customer-validator-users), such as proofreader, editor, reviewer, checker, validator, post-editor, etc. _(only in the Team edition)_

	
  * Project managers and administrators can now create unlimited number of users and select which users will be active _(only in the Team edition)_


[![](/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/active-users-300x228.png)](/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/active-users.png) Unlimited Number of Users; Select Active Users



	
  * Linguists can now access a project's term base in the [linguist portal](http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Linguist_Portal)

	
    * By default linguists may edit "new" (not approved) terms

	
    * A project manager or administrator may, in addition, allow specific linguists to "edit and delete approved terms", effectively promoting that linguist user to a terminologist

	
    * If multiple term bases are selected for a project, only the one in the write mode is displayed to the linguist in the linguist portal




	
  * Unapproved terms ("new" terms) are now displayed in gray in Memsource Cloud, so that they can be easily distinguished from approved terms that are displayed in black color font

	
  * Different translation memories can be assigned to workflow steps in a project _(only in the Team edition)_

	
    * Previously, all workflow steps in a project had to share identical translation memories. Now it is possible to assign different translation memories to different workflow steps in a project




	
  * Alerting a user to the status of the preceding workflow step _(only in the Team edition)_

	
    * If a preceding workflow step has not yet been completed, the user is alerted to this fact - the indicator of the number of segments confirmed turns red and a message is displayed, e.g. "previous workflow step not completed (85% confirmed)"




	
  * For locked jobs, confirming a segment or uploading to server is blocked

	
  * Email templates allow defining a cc email address (e.g. to copy all communication to an email archive)

	
  * When editing multiple jobs at once, users can now decide which specific fields should be batch updated and which should be left intact (these can be removed)

	
  * Improved deployment process

	
    * Minor Memsource releases (these are most frequent) get now deployed without any interruption to the Memsource Cloud service




	
  * New [API calls](http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/MemSource_API) have been added:

	
    * [Project APIs](http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Project_API_v2)

	
    * [Job APIs](http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Job_API_v2)
