Users can now sync Memsource accounts with yet another online repository – **Box**. The [integration](http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Connectors) allows both for manual file import and [Automated Project Creation](https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003948452-Connectors). After a file is translated, it can be uploaded back to the online folder with a modified name.

The Box connector, together with Google Drive, DropBox, Drupal, GitHub and WordPress connectors, is available for all LSP and Enterprise editions.
