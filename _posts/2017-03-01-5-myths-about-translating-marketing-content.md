<span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketers around the world are all trying to do one thing: reach more people. With only </span><a href="http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats7.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">26% of the world’s internet population</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">operating in English, if localization isn’t part of your marketing strategy, it’s likely that billions (yes, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">billions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">!) of non-English customers are slipping through your hands.</span><!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For companies that want to expand globally, a successful strategy must be in place and language considerations should be a part of that. A study by research firm </span><a href="https://www.commonsenseadvisory.com/default.aspx?Contenttype=ArticleDet&tabID=64&moduleId=392&Aid=21500&PR=PR" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Common Sense Advisory</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">surveyed online shoppers from 10 countries and found that 75% of people preferred to make purchases in their native language and a shocking 60% of respondents “never” or “rarely” purchased from English-only websites.</span>

<a href="http://www.commonsenseadvisory.com/default.aspx?Contenttype=ArticleDet&tabID=64&moduleId=392&Aid=36542&PR=PR" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An additional CSA study</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">shows that</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the market for outsourcing translation and interpreting services in the United States </span>surpassed $40 billion in 2016, <span style="font-weight: 400;">and the demand for language services and technology increased by 5.52% from the previous year.</span>

Theses studies tell us that localization is no longer optional, it has become a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">necessity</span>.

Is your team localizing? Why aren’t more companies doing it? Is it really as complex or as expensive as it seems? Let us break down some marketing localization myths for you:

#### **Myth #1 &#8211; Translating content is a complex process**

[<img class="alignright wp-image-13602" src="http://www.memsource.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/top-complicated1.jpg" alt="top-complicated1" width="350" height="179" data-id="13602" />](http://www.memsource.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/top-complicated1.jpg)

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With so many people involved &#8211; the in-house team, external translators, translation agencies &#8211; and many documents needing translation very quickly, getting everyone on the same page with localization can seem like a daunting task. Plus, there’s the technology. Who has the time to get trained on yet another tool? </span>

For marketers, localization doesn’t have to be complicated. There are now easy-to-use systems that can streamline the content translation process.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Translation management systems (TMS) offer a centralized platform that allows global marketing teams to work alongside each other and easily collaborate with translation vendors and freelancers. Companies like </span><a href="http://www.memsource.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SEGA-Case-Study.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sega Networks</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><a href="http://www.memsource.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Case-Study-Citroen.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Citroen</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">can work side-by-side with their in-house translators and chosen translation vendor. Citroen and their translation provider, </span><a href="http://www.memsource.com/blog/2014/02/12/textminded-collaborating-with-our-clients-in-memsource-cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TextMinded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, are able to share data and resources between the marketing team, the in-house translators, and the external TextMinded team.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With a professional TMS, marketers can be completely hands-off. At </span><a href="http://www.memsource.com/blog/2017/01/18/case-study-localizing-ecommerce-websites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennis-Point GmbH</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">h</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">c</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">o</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">m</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">p</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">y</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">o</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">f</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">w</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">r</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">d</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">v</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">l</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">o</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">p</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">m</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">t</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">m</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">set up the new TMS to automatically send new website updates for translation once per week. Additionally, the development team also set up their in-house marketing team in Memsource. This setup allows them to easily send HTML email newsletters twice per week to their translation agency to be localized into 12 languages without having to dive deep into any installation and training procedure. They simply log in, drag and drop their HTML files into an </span><a href="https://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Automation_Widget" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automation Widget</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, set a deadline, approve the cost, and the file is off to the translation agency. When the translation is completed, the marketing team receives a localized HTML file that they can easily import into their EMS.</span>

#### **Myth #2 &#8211; Localization is too expensive and time consuming**

[<img class="alignleft wp-image-13603" src="http://www.memsource.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cash-money.jpg" alt="cash-money" width="350" height="226" data-id="13603" />](http://www.memsource.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cash-money.jpg)

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Is localization really worth it? Is there really a return on value for marketing? Perhaps senior management doesn’t see the value or it seems unnecessary to invest in another technology tool.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A translation management platform is not only a worthy investment, but an affordable one too. Translation management platforms come equipped for </span><a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003692212-Translation-Memories" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">translation memory</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">(TM), a database that stores previous translations over time. Utilizing a translation memory within a CAT tool will save money by eliminating duplicate or repetitive translations. Translators will spend less time on translating the same words and phrases over and over again, and focus instead on making the translation feel natural in the target language. And you will save money because you will never translate the same sentence twice.</span>

[<img class="alignright wp-image-13413" src="http://www.memsource.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Analytics-Costs.png" alt="analytics-costs" width="350" height="395" data-id="13413" />](http://www.memsource.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Analytics-Costs.png)You will also be able to analyze the cost and savings through dashboards. Analytical dashboards can break down costs by vendor, job, or word, show savings over time from translation memory and repetitions, and display job status. Dashboards can easily allow marketers to create visual and dynamic ROI reports for senior management so managers can align marketing localization with company strategies.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And you will also save time. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of time.</span>

<a href="http://www.memsource.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Case-Study-Fujifilm.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fujifilm</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">was able to cut down their localization of InDesign files from 90 minutes to just 15 &#8211; an 80% saving! </span><a href="http://www.memsource.com/blog/2017/01/18/case-study-localizing-ecommerce-websites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennis-Point</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">also saved 30% of their time, 130 days per year, by centralizing and automating their website localization.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember that by localizing more content into multiple languages, you will gain a significant </span><a href="http://www.memsource.com/blog/2016/08/24/10-billion-dollar-companies-that-globalize-content-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">competitive advantage</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in your market. A study by Memsource highlighted how 80 major companies worth over one billion USD are localizing not only their websites, but their additional support sites as well. It is in your company’s financial interest to speak to your customers in their native language across as many mediums as possible &#8211; before your competitors!</span>

#### **Myth #3 &#8211; There’s no way to keep track of what you said last year**

[<img class="alignleft wp-image-13623" src="http://www.memsource.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/disorganization.jpg" alt="disorganization" width="350" height="175" data-id="13623" />](http://www.memsource.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/disorganization.jpg)

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s say you’re already localizing &#8211; but other than digging through proofs and files, or contacting previous freelancers, there’s no way to keep track of what you said a year before, or how your slogan was translated into a specific language. How can you keep track of previous translations and phrases? How can you guarantee the same wording across different marketing collateral and media channels?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies like </span><a href="http://www.memsource.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Case-study-Danfoss.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Danfoss</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">are able to maintain terminology consistency in 20 languages across websites, product catalogues, email newsletters, and more by maintaining translation memory and </span><a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003681851-Term-Bases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">term bases</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">(glossaries) in their TMS. It keeps all the data centralized on their side, and translation memory recognizes full or partial sentences (segments), ensuring they are translated in the same way each time. The term bases keep company phrases, slogans, and key terms consistent across media, regardless of which vendor or translator is doing the localizing. If any term is updated, the central term bases can be modified and the new term will be applied in real time to all current and future projects.</span>

When companies and translation agencies team up together, maintaining glossaries and translation memory not only keeps things consistent, it also allows everyone to save on their budget (another way to save!) and reduce turnaround time.

#### **Myth #4 &#8211; It’s hard to add new languages**

[<img class="alignright wp-image-13604" src="http://www.memsource.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/learn-a-foreign-language1-580x230-ARl53r-clipart.jpg" alt="learn-a-foreign-language1-580x230-arl53r-clipart" width="350" height="139" data-id="13604" />](http://www.memsource.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/learn-a-foreign-language1-580x230-ARl53r-clipart.jpg)

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ve just learned the company is entering a new country and the marketing team needs a plan of entry. How are you going to introduce yourself to your new customers? Just use English? And possibly isolate a large group of customers?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned, the </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">CSA online shopping survey</span>](https://www.commonsenseadvisory.com/default.aspx?Contenttype=ArticleDet&tabID=64&moduleId=392&Aid=21500&PR=PR) <span style="font-weight: 400;">suggests you should definitely take a different approach and speak in your new customers’ native language whenever possible. </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Online job boards</span>](https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003940892-Job-Board) <span style="font-weight: 400;">can help companies connect with language- and region-specific agencies and freelancers to help expand localization offerings.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it a country with less reliable internet connections? No problem, CAT-tools can have both </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">online and offline</span>](https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003484892-Memsource-Editors-Compared) <span style="font-weight: 400;">functionality, keeping the data connected but allowing flexibility for internet connections.</span>

It’s also possible to work with multiple translation vendors to get the best translations and quality checks in specific languages. For example, you can work with your long-standing translation agency as well as a native-speaking freelance translator living in the desired country for a quality check. <span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also find language service providers who specialize in region- or industry-specific areas to ensure the best possible translation. Working with multiple partners can help make expanding your language offerings much simpler.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To take your localization even further, you can look into transcreation services provided by language agencies like </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Xigen</span>](http://www.memsource.com/blog/2016/01/11/xigen-chooses-memsource-to-manage-its-translation-workflow/) <span style="font-weight: 400;">which will bring even more benefits to your multilingual SEO.</span>

#### **Myth #5 &#8211; There are too many mediums and formats**

[<img class="alignleft wp-image-13622" src="http://www.memsource.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/file-types-pattern.png" alt="file-types-pattern" width="350" height="175" data-id="13622" />](http://www.memsource.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/file-types-pattern.png)

<span style="font-weight: 400;">HTML, PDFs, InDesign &#8211; oh my! There’s no way you can easily translate all of these and maintain the same structure and format, right?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wrong. Translation management platforms offer compatibility with dozens of file types (</span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">50+ in Memsource</span>](https://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Memsource_Cloud_User_Manual#Supported_File_Formats)<span style="font-weight: 400;">), including the types marketers use daily such as .pdf, .idml, and .html. CMS systems can also be integrated via API to easily translate websites on platforms like WordPress and Drupal. There’s also increasing demand for multilingual video subtitles and voiceovers which can be managed by partnering with agencies.</span>

[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Fujifilm</span>](http://www.memsource.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Case-Study-Fujifilm.pdf)<span style="font-weight: 400;">’s graphic department easily translates .idml and .pdf files and </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennis-Point’s</span>](http://www.memsource.com/blog/2017/01/18/case-study-localizing-ecommerce-websites/) <span style="font-weight: 400;">team localizes HTML files on a regular basis (remember, we mentioned it earlier). Some CAT-tools also have a live </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">in-context preview feature</span>](http://www.memsource.com/blog/2016/11/16/introducing-in-context-preview/) <span style="font-weight: 400;">that allows translators to see how the localized content will look, eliminating the back-and-forth conversations about increasing or reducing the character count to fit the area.</span>

With a TMS that handles multiple file formats, you will eliminate the need to copy-paste content, maintain strings in a spreadsheet, and many of the other manual localization headaches.
