**On March 15, 2016, at 5pm CET,** we invite you to join us for a special webinar on the **integration of Memsource Cloud and the [hakromedia](http://www.hakromedia.com/) subCloud workbench**.




<!-- more -->


hakromedia subCloud is a browser-based editing tool that allows users to create and edit subtitles that are displayed in real-time against the streaming video.

**Thanks to the flexibility of the Memsource Cloud platform – the result of our powerful extended API – **the multimedia localization company hakromedia GmbH has added an extra dimension to its workflow by developing a connector for subCloud - their flagship editing workbench - to Memsource Cloud.

hakromedia users can now leverage the flexibility of Memsource Cloud and benefit from translation memory, term bases and machine translation.

**PRESENTERS**

-       **Michael Hamm**, Managing Director at hakromedia GmbH

-       **Josef Kubovský**, Head of Sales at Memsource

-       ** Václav Baláček**, Head of Training and Support at Memsource

-          Memsource translation memory-/termbase-supported subtitle translations

-          Barrier-free access to media and subtitling interface for everybody

-          Automated workflow progress for uninterrupt process flow

-          Online customer approval interface with on-the-spot navigation
