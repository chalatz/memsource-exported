](/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_0934.jpg) <span style="font-weight: 400;">We interviewed four of the top names in international game localization at Gamescom 2016. All work for multi-million-dollar game companies, and all are managers or heads of department. We probed them for their insights into the challenges, trends and changes they are currently facing, along with future predictions for the industry.</span>

## **Sarah Beuter &#8211; Head of Localization, Gameforge**

### _<span style="font-weight: 400;">‘If you want to be a game translator, play games</span>__<span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span>_

[<img class="alignleft wp-image-9123 " src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Sarah-Beuter-Photo-e1475664192213-179x300.jpg" alt="sarah-beuter-photo" width="224" height="375" data-id="9123" />](/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Sarah-Beuter-Photo.jpg)**What are the biggest challenges you’re currently facing?**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Deadlines &#8211; we have really short deadlines because all of our games are in live operation and users want constant updates. Also t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he number of languages &#8211; we are doing up to 40 depending on the game. And f</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">inding skilled and reliable translators.</span>

**How do you overcome these challenges?**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;re going through a lot of processes and testing, but many challenges are interconnected. Finding reliable translators for those 40 languages is a struggle for example. </span>

**What do you think the top trends going into 2017 will be?**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">New languages &#8211; for us maybe Brazilian/ Portuguese.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;re always adding more and more. Also c</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rowdsourcing &#8211; not new, but definitely a growing trend. And I think there will be better</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">platforms for crowdsourcing emerging.</span>

**Any tips for other game localization professionals?**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Play games. Lots of people who want to be game translators or game professionals are like- “I like games!”, but they don&#8217;t actually play them. Especially as a game translator you need to understand the language the players speak. </span>

## **Ghulan Khan &#8211; Head of QA and Localization, Sega**

### _<span style="font-weight: 400;">‘We&#8217;ve recently started translating into Greek, Hungarian and Turkish’</span>_

<img class="alignleft wp-image-8609 " src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/AAEAAQAAAAAAAANzAAAAJGZjZWFiZGYxLTViYWMtNGI4Zi1iMDg2LTI0ZDMyODk1NWFmMg.jpg" alt="Ghulan Khan, head of localization at Sega speaks to Memsource" width="275" height="275" data-id="8609" />

**Can you give some examples of non-language related things you would have to change for a particular region?**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In Germany for example, no Nazi symbolry is allowed in games, and blood & gore needs to be toned down. Also changing the names of characters and items to make them more culturally relevant.</span>

&nbsp;

**How do you assess what cultural changes need to be made?**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We use native feedback from target territories; translation, testing, general knowledge to help us ensure it’s all culturally appropriate. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also pay attention to regional laws, eg there are some laws that apply in Germany but not in other territories. </span>

**Can you think of a time you localized into a language and it was a massive failure?**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">No, however it used to be traditional to always localize into what we considered ‘core’ territories like Spain and Italy, whereas some of those &#8216;core&#8217; territories’ are more of a considered decision these days. By the same token other new territories are now being considered as more core.</span>

**Was there an obvious turning point when you realized Italian and Spanish weren&#8217;t such good options?**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">No, it was an accumulation of sales data over a period of time. </span>

**If machine translation became 99% perfect, how would that affect the localization industry?**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I think it would give us more time to get the details really perfect rather than just focus on the basics.</span>

**You don’t think it could ever replace the localization industry?**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I think it could supplant it, but I don&#8217;t think it would fully replace it, no. I would never fully rely on it without some kind of human interaction.</span>

## **Lukas Kotrly &#8211; International Release and Localisation Manager, Deep Silver**

### _<span style="font-weight: 400;">‘The rise of the Asian languages will be one of the big trends of 2017’</span>_

<img class="alignleft wp-image-8610" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/3d7eb10.jpg" alt="Lukas Kotrly, Head of localization at Deep Silver talks to Memsource" width="244" height="244" data-id="8610" />

**What are the top challenges you&#8217;re currently facing?**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Timing, b</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">udgeting and c</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">onsistency. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Projects are driven by timelines rather than quality. It would be best </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to have one translator to do the whole game, but we are often </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">forced or pushe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">d to use teams of 4, 5 or 6 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">people in order to meet the deadlines. We are definitely not following </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the optimal case scenario. </span>

**Has time pressure always been a problem in localization or is it ****more of a** **new problem?**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a new problem, and actually a good one as it is connected with increasing demand for our services in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">general </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and having more p</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">roducts. </span>

**You said consistency. Do you mean consistency of quality?**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Consistency of quality and terminology. This is connected with point number one, i.e. being</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> forced to have teams of 4-5 translators. Even though we&#8217;re using all the CAT tools </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">necessary, it requires lot of effort to have a game translated in one consistent style. Style itself can still only be checked by a human; this is an ongoing fight.</span>

**Any tips for game localization professionals that are not as experienced as yourself?** 

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Don&#8217;t be afraid of technology, and l</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ocalize in the country you&#8217;re localizing into. I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">f a Spanish translator is needed, use a Spanish guy </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">living in Madrid or Valencia. Not an expat living in Prague for example, slowly forgetting the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanish nuances.</span>

**Is that a big problem? If you had a Spanish translator living in France, you wouldn&#8217;t trust him** **as much?**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">No, I would trust the Spanish guy in Spain more. Because I see it happening to me; I&#8217;ve lived abroad </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">for 12 years and my Czech has deteriorated</span>

**Why the rise in Asian languages?**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In general it&#8217;s easier to publish and be present these days in markets like </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">China or Korea, which used to be quite isolated and insular. W</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ith China for example, the Chinese government is much more open, they don&#8217;t cut the games as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">much, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">they don&#8217;t stop them being published in various regions.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">They are more open in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">general.</span>

**What other trends do you predict for 2017?**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Extensive use of CAT Tools and other technologies; I think we&#8217;re slowly moving away from human translation to a hybrid model. Technology and tools help a lot. Also m</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ore and more competition – same as every year!</span>

## **Stefan Dinger &#8211; Head of localization, Ubisoft**

### _<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;German is 30% longer than English; sometimes you have to delete part of a sentence because it does not fit&#8217;</span>_

[<img class=" wp-image-9130 alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Stefan_D-268x300.jpg" alt="stefan_d" width="235" height="263" data-id="9130" />](/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Stefan_D.jpg)

**What are the biggest challenges you&#8217;re currently facing?**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Very big productions start with the translation process much earlier than they used to, meaning we usually work with texts that haven’t been finalized yet. This often means we have to re-translate and update various passages multiple times because they’re being modified constantly, and it can be very challenging to fit those updates into the project schedule. On the other hand, it is very motivating to be part of the development process and to have a deeper insight into the next blockbuster from the beginning. It also allows us to work on a global glossary that other departments like Marketing or PR can use.</span>

**What do you think the top trends will be going into 2017?**

New terminology for the VR devices. Each device has special terminology; for example PS4 terminology for the buttons and hardware is different to that of the XBox, and it will be the same for the new devices.

**Do you have any tips for Localization specialists in the gaming industry?**

Read what you’ve written. We use a lot of text-to-speech to verify our translations and find sentences that sound weird/ spelling mistakes. The computer tells you what you have really written as opposed to what you thought you had written. It’s very helpful.

**Do you think game localization is very different to other types of localization?**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, because it is much more diverse than for other products. The context and the text style is different for every game. For example, we translated the rhymes for Child of Light, a very artsy kind of game, and even invented a “new” fictive speech for the German faction of the adventure game Valiant Hearts. Sometimes you don’t have all the information you need, so you have to guess and use your expertise to get the translation right, and also to bring the right vibe. Compared to movie localization, you often have to produce lip syncs without seeing any lips or the cut-scenes for which they have to be recorded. You only have the audio file of the original actor as a reference point. And finally the volume is much higher; while for a film or a movie you have about 10-15 thousand words to translate, it can be up to 400,000 for a video game.</span>
