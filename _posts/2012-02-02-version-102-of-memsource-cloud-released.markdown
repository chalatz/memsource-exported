We have just released version 1.102 Â of Memsource Cloud, which is now available to all of our users. The are some of the improvements:<!-- more -->



	
  * Optimized process of translation projects with hundreds of files (previously in some cases errors occurred)

	
  * Wildcard search is now available in our translation memory and term base search API (an important side effect is that the wildcard search is now available also from within Memsource Editor and starting with [version 1.19](/memsource-editor-1-19-including-spellchecker-released/), there is even a keyboard shortcut supporting this: Ctrl+Shift+K)

	
  * Our file converter server has been optimized for some rare, even "bizarre" versions of the different file formats that we support


And we have also introduced two Memsource Cloud editions that are completely free of charge: the Personal and Academic editions - more details on our [pricing](http://www.memsource.com/pricing/) page. We will cover this soon, in a separate post.
