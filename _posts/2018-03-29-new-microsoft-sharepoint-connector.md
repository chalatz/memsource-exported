<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have introduced a connector for Microsoft SharePoint. SharePoint is a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">browser-based collaboration and document management platform. </span><!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With the SharePoint Connector, you can use Memsource to translate Microsoft Word, Excel and Powerpoint documents created in SharePoint. You can also translate files in other formats which have been uploaded to SharePoint. See the list of <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000446911-Supported-File-Formats">supported file formats</a> (.zip files are not supported). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This connector is available for our Ultimate and Enterprise users.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more about SharePoint on </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft’s dedicated SharePoint page</span>](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/what-is-sharepoint-97b915e6-651b-43b2-827d-fb25777f446f)<span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
