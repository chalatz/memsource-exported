Early in January as I was leaving my office to go home &#8211; as usual, a bit later than I would like &#8211; I saw a notification come up in my Google Calendar suggesting that I set a New Year&#8217;s resolution. It seems to be a new feature in Google&#8217;s calendar application, as it did not bother me with New Year&#8217;s resolutions in the past years. I kept the notification on my phone for a couple of days but couldn&#8217;t think of a good resolution, so I eventually dismissed it.<!--more-->

A couple of weeks later, I had a meeting with Sarah Good, our Content Manager, and she asked me to contribute to our content creation efforts here at Memsource. I said: Do you know what? I will write an article every month for our blog. I like writing, so I was fond of this idea immediately and thought that I finally have my New Year&#8217;s resolution. Thanks, Google! So here is my first article from the &#8220;Memsource CEO Monthly Article&#8221; series. It is January 31 today, so I think it is probably the last day when one can look at the past year and not be way too late with such a reflection.

So here we go: 2016 was another year of double-digit growth here at Memsource with our sales increasing 80% year-over-year. However, the year was also noteworthy for several other reasons.

### Zero Downtime Deployments

In 2016 we spent a lot of time on improving the way we release new versions of our software. There were two major changes in this area. First, in March, we started deploying not just our minor but also our major releases with [zero downtime](http://www.memsource.com/blog/2016/03/07/our-first-ever-zero-downtime-deployment-of-major-release/). This wasn&#8217;t a trivial task to achieve in terms of engineering but it was a great improvement for our users who rely on Memsource being up and running 24/7.

### Weekly Development Sprints

With our ability to deploy pretty much all versions with zero downtime, it didn&#8217;t make sense to have monthly major releases anymore. Why wait for a month when we can ship that feature next week? Starting in October, we switched to weekly development sprints and synced our deployment cycles with them. This initially created some friction in our marketing efforts: We can no longer advertise a big new version of Memsource since our [new features](http://www.memsource.com/new/) are now released continuously. There aren&#8217;t any more monthly dates towards which all marketing effort is coordinated, culminating at the release date of a major version. We soon realized that it&#8217;s a non-issue &#8211; customers are far more interested in the actual features than a symbolic version number.

### 16 Billion Words Processed in 2016

Over the past year, customers around the world have uploaded files with an aggregate source word count exceeding 16 billion words. In May 2016, we peaked with a monthly word count of over 2 billion.<figure id="attachment_11517" style="width: 621px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

### 359 Million API Requests

In 2016, our customers sent 359 million API requests to our servers from their custom-built integrations, which are typically connections between their in-house systems and Memsource. This number excludes even more API calls that were generated by Memsource-developed integrations, such as our machine translation integrations or the requests between the desktop Memsource Editor and Memsource Web Editor that also use our public API to communicate with Memsource Cloud.<figure id="attachment_11523" style="width: 621px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

### Memsource Team Grows to 50+

Obviously, all of the above would not have been possible without the truly exceptional team that we have here at Memsource and are continuing to build. We grew our team significantly in 2016 and are now over a staff of 50 located in Prague, Vancouver, and Tokyo. We have expanded to the entire floor in our building and are currently renovating the newly added office space. Here is a photo from one the rooms we recently added (pre-renovation), featuring most of the Memsource staff based in Prague:

### And More&#8230;

There was obviously much more that took place in 2016 that didn&#8217;t make it into this blog post. Some of it I cannot share publicly and some of it I want to save for my next blog posts. As I write this, it&#8217;s almost midnight here in Prague. If I want this article to go out by the end January, I have just a few minutes left. So, I am going to hit the &#8220;Publish&#8221; button now and if you enjoyed this post, stay tuned for another one in February.
