<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/LOGO_GLOBE.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-6129 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/LOGO_GLOBE.png" alt="LOGO_GLOBE" width="209" height="198" data-id="6129" /></a></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 1995 Intertranslations has been serving major international clients, mainly in five verticals: pharmaceutical, gaming, software localization, manufacturing and consumer electronics.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With headquarters in Greece and offices in the United Kingdom, Intertranslations offers translation services in all European and Asian languages. In addition to the in-house staff of people, the company works with a global network of industry professionals using the InLance® production platform. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the last few years, <strong>Intertranslations has developed a technological edge</strong> to stay ahead of the competition.</span>

<!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has developed its own Language Quality Inspection (LQI) tool, that identifies suspicious segments in a translation memory during production and sends them to the LQI specialists for further evaluation. Another significant investment has been a customized ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system fully integrated with Memsourse API.</span>

&nbsp;

# <span style="font-weight: 400;">A Lean Quality Assurance Process</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Leveraging the specific features of Memsource Cloud, Intertranslations has acquired a major gaming company as new client. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To </span>**guarantee consistency** <span style="font-weight: 400;">in all elements of a game, terminology databases and translation memories need to be updated in real-time. The</span> **collaborative features for terminology and translation memory management** <span style="font-weight: 400;">offered by Memsource have helped Intertranslation to win &#8211; and retain &#8211; an important customer active in the gaming industry.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Werehiring-12.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-6128 alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Werehiring-12.png" alt="We'rehiring (12)" width="150" height="150" data-id="6128" /></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Xynos, CEO at InterTranslations: “</span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our client can access the terminology management features in Memsource Cloud to make changes to the translation memories and the terminology databases, thus consolidating terminology and making sure mistakes are never repeated.</span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span>

&nbsp;

# <span style="font-weight: 400;">Other Points Scored</span>

**Flexibility and contained costs** <span style="font-weight: 400;">are two other points that Memsource scored with Intertranslations. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Xynos explains: “</span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">We like Memsource’s flexibility as can we integrate it with our own ERP system. We’re also trying to minimize the cost of the translation by integrating and streamlining technology: Memsource is a simple tool to use, and  provides value for money.</span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Mr. Xynos, Memsource also scores in terms of </span>**stability, user-friendliness and a short learning curve** <span style="font-weight: 400;">for the translators.</span>
