Based on user feedback, we have added new SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) [connector](http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Connectors) and improved our FTP connector to support safer file transfer.



 	
  * SFTP is carried over SSH protocol which uses port 22 by default

 	
  * FTP was extended by SSL/TLS support


The SFTP connector, as well as improved FTP connector, is available to Ultimate, Biz Team, Biz Ultimate edition users.
