### SHARED PROJECTS

  * About shared projects 
      * Shared projects have been introduced in our last release ([Memsource Cloud 4.1](/introducing-shared-projects-memsource-cloud-4-1-release/)) but were only available to subscribers with the Ultimate edition. Shared projects make it possible to assign jobs not just to your linguists but also to a &#8220;vendor&#8221; or in other words to another organization that has a paid account in Memsource Cloud. Read more about [shared projects](http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Sharing#Shared_Projects) in our documentation.
  * Shared projects general availability 
      * With the current release we are making shared projects available in all of our paid editions. 
          * Subscribers to the Team and Ultimate editions may act as both buyers and vendors.
          * Subscribers to the 1+ Freelancers and Team Start edition may only act as vendors.
  * Buyer and vendor TM in write mode 
      * Previously, only a single translation memory could be selected in the write mode. Now it is possible to select both a buyer and vendor TM in the write mode in shared projects for saving segments (or the &#8220;write&#8221; mode as we call it).

### TERMINOLOGY

  * Terminology extraction introduced 
      * To extract terms, select relevant jobs in your project and click on Tools &#8211; Extract Terms&#8230;
      * Terms will be extracted into an MS Excel file that can be further edited and/or directly imported into a term base.

[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2352" title="extract-terms" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/extract-terms-300x52.png" alt="" width="300" height="52" />](/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/extract-terms.png)

  * Additional metadata when exporting a term base 
      * When exporting a term base into MS Excel, it is now possible to also export additional metadata for each term, namely: 
          * Created by
          * Created at
          * Last modified by
          * Last modified at

[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2380" title="TB Excel Export Options" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/TB-Excel-Export-Options-300x263.png" alt="" width="300" height="263" />](/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/TB-Excel-Export-Options.png)

### Translation Memory

  * Additional metadata when exporting a translation memory 
      * When exporting a translation memory into MS Excel, it is now possible to also export additional metadata for each segment, namely: 
          * Previous segment
          * Next segment
          * Created by
          * Created at
          * Last modified by
          * Last modified at

### USER MANAGEMENT

  * Guest users may translate 
      * In our previous version, guest users could be enabled to view projects but they could not translate (neither using the Web Editor nor with Memsource Editor)
      * The current version introduces a new setting in the user rights section for guest users to allow them to translate: 
          * &#8220;Edit jobs in Memsource Editors&#8221;
          * Selecting this option will enable them to download the MXLIFF file and translate in Memsource Editor or click on the job name and launch the Web Editor for translating

[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2358" title="guests-may-edit-jobs" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/guests-may-edit-jobs-300x108.png" alt="" width="300" height="108" />](/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/guests-may-edit-jobs.png)

  * TM section now displayed to linguists 
      * The translation memory section is now displayed to linguist users.
      * Please note that this change does not add any extra user rights to linguists. Linguists were already able to view the TM name in Memsource Editor/Web Editor and also search the TM via concordance search
      * The main reason for displaying the TM section is to introduce consistency into the linguist job page layout as we also display the TB page to them
      * Only the TM in the write mode is displayed to linguists in the TM section of the linguist project page (the same is true for the TB section)

### FILE CONVERSION

  * FrameMaker with new file import options 
      * A completely redesigned FrameMaker filter includes a number of new file import options, such as: 
          * &#8220;Extract custom reference pages&#8221;
          * &#8220;Extract hidden conditional text
          * &#8230;

  * IDML soft return 
      * Soft return is now supported MXLIFF files (customized segmentation rules need to be used at the same time)
  * XML segmentation 
      * With the new option &#8220;Segment XML,&#8221; segmentation can be turned off for XML files
  * CSV with new file import options 
      * We have completely redesigned our CSV file filter
      * We have also added new file import options, including an option to process HTML code in the CSV file

[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2366" title="CSV file import options" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/CSV-file-import-options-300x70.png" alt="" width="300" height="70" />](/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/CSV-file-import-options.png)

  * MS Excel with HTML 
      * We have introduced a new file import option to process MS Excel files with HTML code

[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2367" title="MS Excel with HTML" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/MS-Excel-with-HTML-300x159.png" alt="" width="300" height="159" />](/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/MS-Excel-with-HTML.png)

  * Manual file type selection 
      * Previously file type was determined automatically based on the file extension
      * This is still the default behavior but it is now possible to set the file type manually
      * This can be useful when the file type extension is different from the actual file type 
          * For instance, your files are XLIFF but their extension is XML. In this case, selecting XLIFF as file type during file import will make sure the files are imported using the XLIFF file filter and not as XML

  * New Memsource Cloud logo
