## Java / Grails Developer

[spoiler title=&#8221;Job description&#8221;]
  
We are looking for a new member to join our small team to develop the frontend part of the application (UI for translators, public APIs). The frontend application uses the Grails framework and MySQL database. It runs on Linux (Ubuntu) in multiple Tomcat instances behind a load balancer (HAProxy). New minor releases are deployed almost every day to the production environment. We use Subversion for versioning but we plan to switch to Git soon. Geb (Selenium) is used for automated testing. The frontend communicates with the backend parts via JSON APIs.

**We Expect**
  
The ideal candidate does not need to have multiple years’ of experience in this field, nor are there education or certification requirements. However, you will need to be able to demonstrate your knowledge and experience with:
