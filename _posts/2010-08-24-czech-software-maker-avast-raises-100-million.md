The Czech antivirus software maker [AVAST](http://www.avast.com/index) receives $100 million in private equity from Summit Partners, an investment firm. With this investment Summit Partners has acquired a minority stake in the Prague-based company.<!--more-->

AVAST has become a major player in the antivirus industry with its freemium model (it offers its antivirus software for free to individuals and only charges for commercial use). The company claims 1 out of every 5 computers is protected by its antivirus software.

AVAST is not the only Czech antivirus maker that has a global reach. Another big player coming from the Czech Republic is [AVG](http://www.avg.com/) with 68 million users of its software and backed by Intel Capital (to date the largest investment of Intel Capital in Central and Eastern Europe).
