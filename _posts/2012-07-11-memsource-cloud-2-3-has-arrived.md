We have upgraded Memsource Cloud to version 2.3 today at 9:30am GMT. The 2.3 version includes close to 90 improvements and bug fixes, these are some of the new features:<!--more-->

  * Improved processing of XML files 
      * Inline elements can be defined
      * Selected elements can be processed as HTML
      * CDATA can be processed as HTML
      * XML entities can be imported
  * Batch machine translation pre-translation is now supported 
      * Once pre-translated, machine translation can also be used when translating offline in Memsource Editor
      * Custom machine translation engines built in the Microsoft Translator Hub are now supported
  * Word count improvements 
      * Numbers can be optionally excluded from word/character count
      * Multiple consecutive spaces are now counted as a single character
  * Files can now be split by characters; a project manager can choose to split a file into 3 split files, each with the same number of characters (previously files were split by segments which caused some split files being longer than others, albeit with the same number of segments)
  * Inline target formatting (bold, underline, italics) is now recreated independently of the source inline formatting for MS Office files
