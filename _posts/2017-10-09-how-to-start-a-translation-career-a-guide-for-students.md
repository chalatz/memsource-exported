_<span style="font-weight: 400;">Previously, </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">we wrote</span>](https://www.memsource.com/blog/2017/08/11/technology-an-essential-part-of-modern-translation-curricula/) <span style="font-weight: 400;">about the University of Leeds’ </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">MA in Applied Translation Studies program</span>](https://www.leeds.ac.uk/arts/info/125053/centre_for_translation_studies/1803/taught_programmes_cts/2)<span style="font-weight: 400;">, managed by </span>Dr. Dragoș Ciobanu<span style="font-weight: 400;">. Aside from leading a cutting-edge translation program, Dragoș has also spent time working as an in-house translator and cooperating with various translation experts on an international level. We asked him </span>how he would advise students who are interested in establishing a successful translation career<span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>_

<!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To begin, Dragoș noted that the advice he gives aspiring translators largely depends on the country and the language pairs of the graduate and stated that “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">it may be easier to find in-house project management jobs than in-house translation jobs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span>

## <span style="font-weight: 400;">“Those happy to go beyond their comfort zones will always be in high demand.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, he stated that he has “</span>never had a student who was genuinely keen<span style="font-weight: 400;">, made the most of their training program and professional networking opportunities available to them, </span>and did not have a job or a promising freelance career before graduating<span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even when it comes to setting up a freelance business, the success always depends on the proactiveness of the individual: “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who are happy to learn and do more, go beyond their comfort zones, and be professional in every circumstance will </span>always be in high demand <span style="font-weight: 400;">regardless of the industry involved</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This may leave you wondering where to start &#8211; let’s get right into it.</span>

## <span style="font-weight: 400;">What steps should a student take to start a successful translation career?</span>

<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">First of all, </span><b>make sure that your target language standard meets the requirements of the clients</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – in a European Language Industry Association (ELIA) survey taken in 2013, employers were asked the biggest issue they had with incoming translators and the most common response was the quality of the graduate’s native language.<br /> </span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <b>Specialize in only one field initially</b> – just as you can add languages later on in your career, you can also add specialties<span style="font-weight: 400;">. Being proficient in language and translation theory is not enough to create a quality translation, it is important to have an understanding of what you are writing about.<br /> </span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Pay close attention to the requirements of the clients</strong>. Don’t hesitate to ask questions in order to obtain clear instructions and </span>make sure that your translations meet their needs rather than your own<span style="font-weight: 400;"> idea of how they should be done.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This step may vary if you are working with agencies as opposed to your own clients. Agencies should, and often do, know what their client needs, but checking their terms and conditions very carefully before working with them is always a good rule to follow. It is important to understand who will be held responsible if the client is unhappy with the quality of the translation. If the translator is solely blamed for the outcome then it may be wise to consider looking for a different agency or language service provider. Without shared responsibility for the end product, the agency has little incentive to put in the necessary work to learn the client&#8217;s specific needs.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often, your client may think they understand what they need, but are actually misguided. What your clients have is a problem and it is your job to find the most suitable solution without patronizing them in the process.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Take time to clearly </span><b>understand the technology involved in a localization workflow,</b> <b>the people involved, and their roles</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Unfortunately, many linguists are not aware that they are actually part of a chain, which means that other people and tasks depend on them performing these tasks to a certain standard and within a specific time frame.<br /> </span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <b>Do not translate with the expectation that there will be someone else to revise your work</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> afterwards. Some LSPs don’t do the minimum amount of revisions they promise their clients and even when they do, spot-checking is more common than a full revision.<br /> </span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Join your </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_translators_and_interpreters_associations"><span style="font-weight: 400;">local or national organizations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and take a look at their professional codes of conduct. <strong>Be an active member of the industry!</strong><br /> </span>
</li>
  1. Join professional social media groups and discussions. Don’t hesitate to **share information** with your colleagues – after all, a rising tide lifts all boats.
  2. Bolster your experience while **giving back to the community** by getting involved with initiatives such as the [Translation Commons](https://translationcommons.org/) and, after you have acquired a little more experience, [Translators without Borders](https://translatorswithoutborders.org/).
  3. There are numerous opportunities to learn: look for relevant training courses, webinars, and conferences – **invest in yourself**. At the end of the day, this is what will keep you motivated moving forward.

In summary, as an active member of the localization community, it is important to provide high-quality service that is tailored to the needs of your clients. Your pricing should be fair to clients while remaining high enough to keep you motivated. Understand the value of your work, invest in both your specialty and your technical set-up, and compete with quality, not with rates. Lastly, take advantage of the latest language technologies in order to save everyone time and &#8211; ultimately &#8211; money.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Caption: Senior EU and UN linguists speaking about careers in their institutions to University of Leeds students during the yearly </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">CTS</span>](http://www.leeds.ac.uk/arts/info/125053/centre_for_translation_studies) <span style="font-weight: 400;">Language Technologies Training Week</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to remember that it is not always possible to produce high-level work in a quick and inexpensive manner, but don’t let that discourage you. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This leads us to another very important aspect of the translation career:</span>

## <span style="font-weight: 400;">How does a translator remain competitive?</span>

<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Continuously work on your specialty</strong>: attend the meetings of your local </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Interest_Group"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Special Interest Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, take relevant </span><a href="http://mooc.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MOOCs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on a regular basis, and attend conferences within your target industry. It is also beneficial to </span><b>build a portfolio of direct clients</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in addition to the language service providers and agencies.<br /> </span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Never. Stop. Learning. </b>Sign up for a wide range of free webinars available (most CAT tools providers organize them – </span><a href="https://www.memsource.com/webinars/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Memsource included</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – and so do some LSPs, such as </span><a href="http://www.moravia.com/en/knowledge-center/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moravia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). If possible, aim to attend at least one industry conference a year – check with the associations in your area or refer to a language technology provider to see what is available.</span><b><br /> </b>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Regularly step away from your social circle and try to </span><b>understand your clients</b> and where they are coming from<span style="font-weight: 400;">.<br /> </span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Subscribe to industry newsletters and follow technical trends – here you are spoiled with choices, from the countless varieties of communication channels in professional associations to all the free newsletters, such as </span><a href="http://www.internationalwriters.com/toolkit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tool Box Journal (the Basic version)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Aggregators, such as </span><a href="https://slator.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slator</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and worthwhile investments like </span><a href="https://multilingual.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multilingual</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or the Premium version of the Tool Box are also important resources to help understand the translation world today. In short, </span><b>stay up to date</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.<br /> </span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <b>Use social media</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for professional purposes. Create a trustworthy name for your “brand” and share useful and relevant material with your clients and fellow translators.<br /> </span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Take the latest translation prophecies (they tend to surface regularly) with a grain of salt, and always seek to find the real story behind the headline. </span><b>Approach all new technical developments critically</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and look to see whether they would bring you or your clients any real advantages.</span>
</li>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Successfully graduating and finding your first clients is</strong> </span>**just the beginning**<span style="font-weight: 400;">. You should strive to get better, seek and welcome change, share knowledge and goodwill, avoid forming strong opinions too early (if at all), expand your social circle, don’t take yourself too seriously, meet your clients’ needs while remaining professional, evaluate situations from several perspectives, and regularly attempt to step out of your comfort zone. Now it is your turn to get started.</span>
