Recently, Google has changed the Terms of Use for Google Translate. This is probably related to the overhaull of Google privacy policies and the related legal documents. As a result, it seems, that for all  Google's API services there is now just one set of terms of use. Things got simpler but also perhaps a bit too general.<!-- more -->

In the previous version, which is now nowehere to be found, Google clearly stated that it “**will not share**” the content [submitted for translation] with a third party. In the new terms of use, the language is a bit more obscure:

_"By submitting, posting or displaying content to or from the APIs through your API Client, you give Google a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, adapt, modify, translate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such content. However, Google will only use such content for the purpose of enabling Google to provide the APIs and only in accordance with the applicable Google privacy policies."_

I think this still means that Google will still not share the content submitted for machine translation - at least this seems to be the practice. And given Google's business focus, it is not so much interested in corporate secrets as much as as in the details of our private lives.
