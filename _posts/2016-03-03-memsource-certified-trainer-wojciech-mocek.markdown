**[![Wojciech_Mocek_photo](/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Wojciech_Mocek_photo.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Wojciech_Mocek_photo.jpg)Wojciech Mocek**, CAT tools engineers at _Squint Your Eyes (and Imagine You are Going Global)_

**Years of experience in the translation industry:** 8,5.

**Years of experience as Memsource user:** 6 months.<!-- more -->

**Why did you choose to become Memsource Certified Trainer?** Because, after 8 and a half years in the translation industry, I believe that Memsource is a great tool and I really enjoy it. Apart from that, I was also responsible to move the company [PureFluent](http://en.purefluent.com/) from SDL Trados Studio to Memsource.

**In which language(s) will you give Memsource training? **English and Polish.

**What activities are you developing - or have developed - as Memsource trainer? **I am currently extending the audience/customers who are interested in buying CAT tools and trying to show them how CAT tools can help them in their work and cut the costs in their business.

**What kind of audience do you plan to train/are you training?** Translation agencies, translators and proofreaders, translation departments of various companies.

**Which are the most useful Memsource functionalities for your work?** Filters customization (especially [XML filter](http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/XML) and [Excel filters](http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/MS_Excel)), [automation widgets](http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Automation_Widget), automation of translators' assignment.

**What do you like most about Memsource?** That it is web-based and a very clear, customizable, [API-enabled environment](http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Memsource_API).

**Anything else you would like to share?** I have been passionate about Memsource since the first time I learnt about this platform. At that time, I was working as CAT tools engineer for a British translation agency and my daily work relied on SDL Trados Studio, which was an increasingly difficult experience. I have moved the whole company to Memsource and immediately started to see a positive difference. Now I am trying to investigate Memsource even more to answer the increasing number of requests related to Memsource Cloud.
