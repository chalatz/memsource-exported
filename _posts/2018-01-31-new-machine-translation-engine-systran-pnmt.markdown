Memsource now supports a new neural machine translation engine - Systran Pure Neural Machine Translation (PNMT) engine. Systran PNMT models the entire process of machine translation through an artificial neural network.

<!-- more -->

This technology is based on complex algorithms at the forefront of Deep Learning and enables the PNMT engine to learn and produce higher quality translations. Systran Enterprise Server 7, a statistical MT engine, is still available in Memsource.

You can learn more about the Systran PNMT engine on the [Systran website](http://www.systransoft.com/systran/translation-technology/pure-neural-machine-translation/). To find out how to set up Systran PMNT in Memsource, see the [Machine Translation](https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003934452) article in our Help Center.
