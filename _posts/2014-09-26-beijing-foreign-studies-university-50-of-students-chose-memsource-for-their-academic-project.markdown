_This customer testimonial has been provided by Simon Sun, Assistant Professor of Translation at Beijing Foreign Studies University._

![](/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Beijing_Foreign_Studies_University-300x300.jpg)“My students learned how to use Memsource and other mainstream CAT tools last semester. For the final project, they were requested to finish a project using a CAT tool of their choice. It turned out that almost half of the 50 students selected Memsource. I think it is remarkable for a relatively "new kid on the block". Congrats.”<!-- more -->
