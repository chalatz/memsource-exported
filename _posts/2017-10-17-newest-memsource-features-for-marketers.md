<span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketers, rejoice! Memsource has recently released connections with AEM and Marketo and support for Photoshop files, making it easier to translate even more marketing content.</span><!--more-->

### **[<img class="alignright wp-image-17147" src="https://www.memsource.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/aem6.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" data-id="17147" />](https://www.memsource.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/aem6.png)**Plugin for Adobe Experience Manager

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Memsource Translation Plugin for Adobe Experience Manager enables managers to efficiently produce global multilingual web and mobile content to speak to local markets around the world.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Within the AEM 6.2 platform, users can choose content for translation, request a Scope from the preferred Vendor, select a due date, and then send directly to Memsource for translation with a single click. Statuses will change in AEM as the project in Memsource progresses through the translation process. Users will receive an automated email notification when the translation is ready for approval or revision.</span>

The plugin for AEM is available by <a href="https://www.memsource.com/contact-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contacting the Sales team</a> and is coming soon to the AEM Marketplace. Learn more about setting up the AEM Plugin in our <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003461031-How-to-set-up-and-use-Memsource-Translation-Plugin-for-AEM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Support Center</a> and <a href="https://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Adobe_experience_manager_plugin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documentation</a>.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Marketo Connector allows Memsource users with Ultimate and Unlimited editions to pull emails, files, landing pages, and forms directly into Memsource for translation and pushes the translated content back into the Marketo system. Users can select content to be pulled for translation either manually or automatically.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Adobe Photoshop .psd files can be imported, automatically recognized, and processed as a supported file format. This includes support for both hidden and locked layers. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">P.S. Want to also translate </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">PDF</span>](https://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/PDF) <span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">InDesign</span>](https://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Adobe_InDesign) <span style="font-weight: 400;">files?
