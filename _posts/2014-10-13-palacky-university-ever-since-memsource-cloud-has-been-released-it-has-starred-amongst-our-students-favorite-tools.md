<span style="color: #000000;"><em>This customer testimonial has been provided by <em>Dr. Pavel Král, teacher of translation technology at Palacky University.</em></em></span>

&#8220;The Translation and Interpreting study programme at Palacky University in Olomouc, Czech Republic, aims to give the students the broadest hands-on experience possible by giving them access to the latest generation of translation technology tools.<!--more--> The Memsource Technologies company kindly supports our institution by giving access to their cloud-based service Memsource Cloud, free of charge. Their on-line service is used in Computer Aided Translation courses for students to receive hands-on-training in real-life translation project scenarios. In order to prepare the students for the diverse needs of the translation market we teach various technical skills using various translation technology tools. It is necessary to say though, that ever since Memsource Cloud has been released, it has starred amongst our students&#8217; favorite tools for its straightforwardness, interface clarity and low maintenance requirements for the end user.&#8221;
