We have just released a new version of the UTMA server and plugins. The main new features are listed below.<!-- more -->



**The Server**

_A new reporting module. _

__1. Plugin usage statistics get captured, detailing the number of:



	
  * views of the Replace/Confirm Dialog Box

	
  * strings that got replaced

	
  * strings that got confirmed


2. String matches from the internal repository within the UTMA server  get displayed along with matches from the translation memory

**Plugins**

1. New strings with a 100% match against a confirmed string do not get highlighted anymore

2. New strings are split  into two groups:

a) those with no match are highlighted in green so that the developer can confirm them right away;

b) those with a match are highlighted in yellow, encouraging the developer to  check the available alternatives

3. Update centers have been introduced for comfortable plugin updating.
