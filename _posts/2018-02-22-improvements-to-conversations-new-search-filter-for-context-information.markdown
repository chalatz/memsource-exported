There are some exciting new changes in the latest versions of the Memsource Desktop Editor and Memsource Web Editor.

## Have Better Conversations in Memsource


We have made improvements to the Conversations feature in Memsource Desktop Editor and Memsource Web Editor to make it more user-friendly.

The Conversations pop-up can now be moved around in the Editors. In the Desktop Editor, it can be attached to the right or left-hand side of the main editor window (see the gif below). 

We have also made some changes to our keyboard shortcuts. Ctrl+M can now be used to open the comments window to view, edit, and contribute to conversations, while new comments can be added to conversations using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+M.

## Filter Segments by Context Note and Context Key

Some types of files that can be translated in Memsource store[ contextual information](https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003462131-Context-Information-in-Memsource-Editors). This information can be very important when it comes to understanding and correctly translating content. 

The Context Key and Context Note are displayed in the Context section at the bottom of the Editors.
