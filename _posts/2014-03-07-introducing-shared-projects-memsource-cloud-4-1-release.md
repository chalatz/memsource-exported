Memsource Cloud 4.1 has been released on Sunday, 9 March 2014 at 9:15 AM GMT. Memsource Cloud 4.1 includes over 100 improvements and bug fixes. Below are the most important new features:<!--more-->

### Shared Projects

  * The completely new set of [shared projects](http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/MemSource_Cloud_User_Manual#Shared_Projects) features are a bit of a revolution 
      * These features make it possible for separate organizations in Memsource Cloud to collaborate. Before version 4.1 translation jobs could only be assigned to linguist users. Starting with 4.1, translation jobs (more precisely projects) can be assigned to other organizations that have an account in Memsource Cloud. These are some examples of how the new shared projects feature can be used: 
          * An enterprise Memsource Cloud customer can assign projects to a translation company in Memsource Cloud
          * An MLV (multi-language vendor) can assign projects to SLVs (single-language vendors)
          * A translation company can assign projects to Memsource users with the 1+ Freelancers account (and not just to linguist users)
      * Availability: 
          * Currently only organizations with the Ultimate edition can start using the shared project functionality.
          * However, we plan to extend its availability to other editions soon.

### User Management

  * Guest user rights modifications 
      * A new setting &#8220;Show linguist names&#8221; has been introduced 
          * This setting makes it possible to show/hide linguist names for guest users and by default is not selected

  * Options to create/delete projects, TMs and TBs removed
  * Option to modify projects removed 
      * The reason for these changes is to position the guest role as, primarily, a read-only role
      * We will soon be introducing another solution for a &#8220;guest-like&#8221; user to create projects or jobs

### Quality Assurance

  * A new QA check introduced 
      * &#8220;Maximum target segment length in % of source&#8221; has been introduced as a new QA check

### Machine Translation

  * Set machine translation per target language 
      * Previously it was possible to set just a single MT engine per project
      * Now it is possible to set MT engines by target language in a project

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2250" title="mt-per-target" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/mt-per-target.png" alt="" width="298" height="162" />](/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/mt-per-target.png)

  * MoraviaMT introduced 
      * A new machine translation engine has been introduced, primarily for Moravia and its partners
  * NICT MT engine connector upgraded 
      * Our NICT MT engine connector has been upgraded to comply with the latest version of the NICT MT engine

### Other

  * Custom logos 
      * Custom logos will now be displayed also on the Memsource Cloud sign in page
      * Previously, Memsource Cloud logo was displayed there, irrespective of whether an organization used a custom logo or not
