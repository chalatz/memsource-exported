Our new REST APIs are now complete. In October 2017, we launched our first batch of REST APIs (see our [blog post](https://www.memsource.com/blog/2017/10/24/introducing-rest-apis-qa-with-the-memsource-api-team/) for more information). Since then, our API team has been busy making improvements and developing new REST APIs.

The latest batch of APIs to be released includes our [Job API](https://cloud.memsource.com/web/docs/api/#operation/createJob), our[ Import Settings API](https://cloud.memsource.com/web/docs/api/#operation/createImportSettings), and our [User API](https://cloud.memsource.com/web/docs/api/#operation/getUser). We have also been working to make our [REST API documentation](https://cloud.memsource.com/web/docs/api) more user-friendly.
