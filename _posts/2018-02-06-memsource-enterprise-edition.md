The launch of this edition came from conversations about providing a better option for global corporations that need a custom technical setup with a flexible licensing policy. The flat-rate pricing option in this edition relieves the headache of budgeting a specific figure for translation technology in an ever-changing localization landscape. With the flat rate fee, you know what you will pay no matter how your usage evolves.
