### PROJECT MANAGEMENT





	
  * **Introducing the instant quote widget**

	
    * The instant quote widget makes it extremely easy for anyone to submit new translation jobs into Memsource and receive instant word count and even a quote. All a person needs to do is click on a link (from a website or intranet - try it yourself) and upload the files for translation. **No Memsource login information is needed**. Once translated, the person is notified by email and can download the translated files and so the instant quote feature can serve as a mini translation portal:

      * Translation agencies can provide instant quote widgets to their customers and so receive more jobs for translation from them - because the instant quote widget is so easy and convenient to use.

	
      * Translation buyers can distribute instant quote widgets to any number of their business units and streamline the internal translation process.


	
    * The instant quote widget is  essentially a URL that can be generated by a Memsource administrator or project manager under Setup - Instant Quotes. an instant quote widget can be associated with a project template in order to apply specific project settings, use a specific price list, translation memories for the analysis, term bases for terminology, etc.

    * A Memsource organization can create any number of instant quote widgets. For instance, a translation company could create an instant quote widget:

	
      * For each of their major customers

	
      * For their website




	
    * The instant quote feature is available to subscribers of all Memsource editions except Personal and 1+ Freelancers.


	
  * **Introducing quotes**

	
    * This feature is currently only available to the subscribers of the new [business editions](http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/MemSource_Editions#Editions_for_Translation_Buyers) that have been designed for translation buyers.

	
    * A new section "Quotes" is displayed in projects.

	
    * A quote can be created based on an existing analysis in a project; a price list and a net rate scheme can be applied.

	
    * A quote can have the following statuses:

	
      * New

	
      * Approved

	
      * Declined




	
    * Quotes can be useful for shared projects, e.g. a translation buyer can ask a vendor (translation company) to provide a quote that can be later approved by the buyer.

	
    * Quotes are available to subscribers with one of the business editions (BIZ Start, BIZ Team or BIZ Ultimate)
