**Years of experience in the translation industry**: **20.**

**Years of experience as Memsource user**: 4<!-- more -->

**Why did you choose to become Memsource Certified Trainer? **Our LSP has never concealed its passion for Memsource. When competitor companies, the Union of Translators of Russia and especially colleagues from translation schools, approached us with questions regarding platforms and software for translators, we organized several Memsource workshops for students and teachers in 2014 and 2015. We also took part in [the UTIC event of 2013](http://2013.utic.eu/en/member/joseph-kubovsky-2/) as Memsource co-speakers. I have already been training third parties for many years; for this reason, I have become an official Memsource Certified Trainer.

**In which language(s) will you give Memsource training**? Russian and German

**What activities are you developing - or have developed - as Memsource trainer? **I act as Memsource helpdesk for managers and linguists of AKM Translations. I am responsible for solving problems, teaching beginners, integrating new Memsource features into our technology and issuing in-house instructions.

**What kind of audience do you plan to train/are you training? **I used to speak to decision makers and technologists of other LSPs. I would rather focus on administrators and PMs, and explain QA, automation options and fine tuning of the Memsource Cloud platform. I am also ready to help students and teachers at academic institutions by integrating Memsource into their curriculum.

**Which are the most useful Memsource functionalities for your work? **Customized workflow, build-in QA, online quoting with automation widget, PEMT-ready platform, term and segment search, autocompleting, compatibility with Mac and Linux.

**What do you like most about Memsource? **It helps to ensure better quality, cut cost and shorten delivery dates thanks to synergy of group work.

**Anything else you would like to share? **I’d like to draw everybody’s attention to the free Academic Edition. It is very easy to make Memsource a part of academic education. The Personal Edition (for occasional and amateur translators) is also free and highly recommended for students and beginners.
