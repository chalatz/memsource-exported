Earlier today we have released version 1.102.7 of Memsource Cloud as well as version 1.21 of Memsource Editor. Both are minor releases.

The new version of Memsource Cloud brings improved import options for zip files and specifically addresses encoding issues related to file names in the zip file. Read more on importing [zip files](http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Zip_Files) into Memsource on our wiki.<!--more-->

The new version of Memsource Editor fixes issues with some users not being able to connect to Memsource Cloud from the Editor.

As for version numbering of Memsource Cloud &#8211; we will stay for some time with the version 1.102 now,  as we are getting ready for a major release of Memsource Cloud 2.0. We will share more on this soon.
