The following testimonial was provided by Jesus Cordero, communications coordinator for Global Network of Civil Society Organisations for Disaster Reduction (GNDR).<!-- more -->

"As a global network working towards international development, we rely on volunteers worldwide to translate most of digital content for our Spanish, French and Arabic members. Having used several CAT tools in the past myself, I chose Memsource for GNDR because of how simple it is to use for volunteers who have never tried a CAT-tool before. They can use it online or go offline with the free desktop application. It has a simple and intuitive interface and all necessary features, but without an overwhelming array of options to put off new users".

"These options are under the bonnet, ready for project managers. The align feature of Memsource, for instance, helps me to import our past translations into memories and termbases to leverage later. Volunteers do not need to start from scratch when selecting the correct terminology that we use in disaster reduction and humanitarian relief. For me, being in charge of translation, Memsource makes project distribution and management a breeze, whether I'm dealing with a large or small volume of work. For example, I love the file-split feature which allows me to have two volunteers working separately on the same file. In summary, Memsource allows me to manage our volunteer translations without investing in software that only agencies and busy freelancers can afford".
