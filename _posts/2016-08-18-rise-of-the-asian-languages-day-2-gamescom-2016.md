_<span style="font-weight: 400;">VR games are a new trend in gaming. What will their localization be like?</span>_

<span style="font-weight: 400;">More focus on Asian languages, better analytics, and quantitative feedback from players are the top three localization trends to be expected in 2017. Day 2 of Gamescom 2016 saw the doors open to the public, and as the exhibition halls filled up with tens of thousands of people, we were behind the scenes probing the experts for their insights into the future of game localization.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Checking for quality is now increasingly done by players themselves, rather than outsourced to an agency. Martin Korenek of Wooga described how in the last year his company has started using direct in-game player surveys to get accurate user feedback, due to the cost-effectiveness and reliability this method affords. He says growing numbers of games companies have started following this trend, however it has not become mainstream yet. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /> <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_0821.jpg"><img class="wp-image-8384 alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_0821.jpg" alt="IMG_0821" width="518" height="388" data-id="8384" /></a>Lucas Kotrly, localization manager at Deep Silver tells us that one of his core priorities for 2017 is to find a concrete way to produce accurate data on how much profit localization is making for the company. This is an ongoing problem for localization specialists; until now no reliable method has been conceived, and even the biggest companies can do little more than speculate based on sales figures from previous releases.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucas also talks of how the changing political and economic environment in Eastern Asia makes it easier for games companies to have a stronger presence there than was previously possible. This is inevitably leading to more games being published, along with an increased market share, and in his own words, </span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">‘the rise of the Asian languages will certainly be one of the big changes in 2017.’</span>_
