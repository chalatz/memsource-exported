AVAST has become a major player in the antivirus industry with its  freemium model (it offers its antivirus software for free to individuals  and only charges for commercial use). The company claims 1 out of every  5 computers is protected by its antivirus software.

AVAST is not the only Czech antivirus maker that has a global reach. Another big player coming from the Czech Republic is [AVG](http://www.avg.com/) with 68 million users of its software and backed by Intel Capital (to  date the largest investment of Intel Capital in Central and Eastern  Europe).
