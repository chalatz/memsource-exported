Memsource CEO, David Canek, will present with Torben Dahl Jensen, Partner at TextMinded, on "Collaborating with Our Clients in the Cloud." Session outline:

_A year ago, TextMinded completed the development of a solution that integrated their own terminology management system, enterprise-level MT, and Memsource Cloud. The goal of the solution was to enhance client collaboration, especially with those clients that had in-house translators, terminologists, and other experts that TextMinded needed to work with closely. The solution has produced excellent benefits, albeit with a few challenges, and some welcome surprises as well. This session will dissect the project, examining the need, the solution, and the outcome._
