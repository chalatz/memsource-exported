The Automated Project Creation now allows users to monitor not only the entire folders, but choose a list of files that can be monitored in the selected folder.

By using this option you do not need to worry about inappropriate files being drawn for translation since the unselected files will be ignored each time the check is carried out. This can be especially useful if the translatable content is only being added into the existing files instead of new versions of documents being created.
