Now that the holiday break is finally over, we can resume our normal programming schedule.

We would like to start by announcing some of the events of 2016 where you can meet and greet our team. Our colleagues will be happy to listen and talk about your technological needs and issues.

Of course, we also welcome non-Memsource users to come and take a peek at what’s under the bonnet of our platform and future features.<!--more-->

## Pocket Gamer Connects

On **January 18th &#8211; 19th** you can find us in London, at [Pocket Gamer Connects](http://www.pgconnects.com/london/). This is the must-attend event for the **mobile games business** with participants coming from the four corners of the world. Following the implementation of the Memsource platform many game localization companies have registered great results in terms of workflow optimization, team management and productivity. Sales rep Bryan Hutchinson is going to represent us there.
