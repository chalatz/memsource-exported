We're planning on staging an interesting webinar on the 17th of December with Chris Wendt from Microsoft, Jan Hofmeister from Moravia,  Torben Dahl Jensen from TextMinded and our CEO David Canek. To sum up what has happened in 2014 and glimpse at what 2015 might hold, we chose the topic of Translation Trends 2015. Each speaker will present their vision of what the main innovation drivers in 2015 will be.<!-- more -->



For our part, we're going to unveil fascinating statistics on cloud CAT-tool user base growth, an increase in level of integration between buyers and sellers of translation, and rise of machine translation in professional localization services. David Canek will outline Memsource’s 2015 product roadmap in response to what is happening in the market.
