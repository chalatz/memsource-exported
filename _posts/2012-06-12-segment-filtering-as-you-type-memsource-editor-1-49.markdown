Earlier today we have started pushing Memsource Editor 1.49 to our users. As always, Windows, Mac and Linux versions are available. Two major features stand out in this release:<!-- more -->


### Segment filtering


Segments get filtered literally as you type into the filter box - for source or target segments or a combination. Filtering by segment status and some additional related improvements will be available in one of the next releases.


### Segment sorting


This feature makes it possible to sort segments alphabetically, which can speed up translating numbers or other non-translatbles.

To get a better idea, [try it yourself](http://www.memsource.com/pricing/) or [watch this video](http://youtu.be/Cx2Lb_HCm5w).
