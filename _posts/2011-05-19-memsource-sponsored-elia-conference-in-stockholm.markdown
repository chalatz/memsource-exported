This year's [ELIA Networking Days in Stockholm](http://www.elia-association.org/index.php?id=ndstoc) was definitelyÂ a conference worth going to. Unfortunately we did not have much time to attend the presentations as we ran one demo of the Memsource Translation Server after another.<!-- more -->

The conference hosted 103 participants representing 79 companies based in 28 different countries.
