The following customer testimonial has been provided by Mr. Matthew Roselli, professional Italian to English translator and certified post-editor.

[![](/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/matthew.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/matthew.jpg)"I have been a professional freelance translator for 5 years now. I discovered Memsource in 2013 and since then, it has become my #1 CAT tool. That is actually an understatement, as it does not express how much more I prefer it to two desktop CAT tools I own. In fact, I use the others only when directly asked to by an agency.

If you are an experienced (and certified) Machine Translation Post-Editor such as myself, Memsource is the product for you. I have tried others, and there simply is no comparison".
