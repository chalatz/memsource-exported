When submitting files for translation via Automation Widgets, clients can enter purchase order number for reference. Then, a Project Manager can easily [filter](https://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Memsource_Cloud_User_Manual#Project_Filter) all projects sharing the same purchase order number on the Projects tab, [save the filter](https://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Memsource_Cloud_User_Manual#Save_a_Project_Filter) and reuse it when necessary.
