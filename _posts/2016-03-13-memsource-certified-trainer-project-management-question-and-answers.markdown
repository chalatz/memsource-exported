<td width="376" >**Answer**
</td>
</tr>
<tr >

<td width="376" >Is it possible to penalise terms based on term status?
</td>

<td width="376" >No, this is not possible. However, translators can see the status in the “metadata section” in the bottom right corner of their translation editor.
</td>
</tr>
<tr >

<td width="376" >Automation Widget: Can the billing unit be changed based on workflow step?
</td>

<td width="376" >No, the billing unit can only be set per Service.
</td>
</tr>
<tr >

<td width="376" >Are there any options for performing pre-prep tasks within MemSource? (e.g. locking text)
</td>

<td width="376" >Yes, segments can be locked manually, either segment by segment, or in batches. Locking is also part of the pre-translation options.
</td>
</tr>
<tr >

<td width="376" >Where can we have access to the recorded session?
</td>

<td width="376" >All of you should have received a follow-up e-mail by now, with a link to the recording.
</td>
</tr>
<tr >

<td width="376" >Does Memsource have an automatic invoicing system? If not, do you have plans to add it?
</td>

<td width="376" >Memsource does not have invoicing, and building one is not part of our short-term plans. Memsource offers reports, based on which you can get data for billing purposes, for example “all jobs completed during this month for this specific client”. In addition, and more importantly, Memsource offers integration with business and translation management systems Plunet and XTRF (listed in alphabetical orderJ).
</td>
</tr>
<tr >

<td width="376" >If I split a file into three parts in the translation step, how can I condense the revision of those three jobs in one in the revision step?
</td>

<td width="376" >When you select a job to split, there is a dialogue box with an option to “split this file in all workflow steps”. This makes it possible for you to split the file in one step, and leave it as one in the next step. However, even if you split your file in all steps, the splitting is just “virtual” and the file itself is not affected. Therefore, you can assign all three parts to the reviewer, and because multiple files can be open in Memsource Editors, this will be effectively the same as if you assign the file as one.
</td>
</tr>
<tr >

<td width="376" >Do we really need termbases if we have TM?
</td>

<td width="376" >Yes, TBs and TMs are completely different concepts. TMs store all your translations, all sentences you translate, while TBs are like dictionaries, glossaries of key terms. TBs and TMs serve completely different purpose.
</td>
</tr>
<tr >

<td width="376" >What version are you using? I have a license for StartTeam and many options are not there
</td>

<td width="376" >I was using BizTeam, which is very similar to Team. Team Start does not have some features, like the automatic activation/deactivation of users or workflow steps. Please [read this article](http://support.memsource.com/topic/what-are-the-main-differences-between-the-team-and-team-start-editions) for details.
</td>
</tr>
<tr >

<td width="376" >Can widgets be localized/translated? I mean the interface.
</td>

<td width="376" >Yes, widgets can be switched to all of the 12 languages into which Memsource UI is localized.
</td>
</tr>
<tr >

<td width="376" >Will the Home page be available to Freelance +1 accounts?
</td>

<td width="376" >We currently do not plan to introduce a Home page for Freelancer+1 users.
</td>
</tr>
<tr >

<td width="376" >Is there a dummy account I can use with full access? I have only Freelance +1, and to get certified, I need to see all functionality
</td>

<td width="376" >Yes, please feel free to create a 30-day trial of Team for this purpose. Alternatively, please contact our sales department (sales@memsource.com), and ask them to convert your account to Team for a trial period.
</td>
</tr>
<tr >

<td width="376" >If a Machine Translation is used, where does that data get saved? Does it enter the MT database (i.e., public domain)?
</td>

<td width="376" >This depends on which MT engine you use. Please note that Memsource only provides API connection to MT services. You should consult the terms and conditions of each MT provider before you start working with them. From what we know, Google MT for example stores the source text only, not the translations. This is an example of one of the MT engines that are quite complicated in terms of confidentiality. On the other hand, some of the solutions available from Memsource give you space where you train your own proprietary MT.
</td>
</tr>
<tr >

<td width="376" >At the moment, I only have access to Memsource as a linguist. My client (PM) sends me projects to work on and I log in. Once the project(s) is/are finished, I am logged out and don't have access again. How do I get access as a PM in order to be able to train others?
</td>

<td width="376" >You need to create your own account from here.
</td>
</tr>
<tr >

<td width="376" >Is there a way to create a project from several source languages? Eg. English/Spanish into Czech/Slovak?
</td>

<td width="376" >No, this is not possible. It always has to be one source language.
</td>
</tr>
<tr >

<td width="376" >I'd like to know a little bit about TM compatibility, tmx and other formats
</td>

<td width="376" >Memsource makes it possible to export/import TMs into/from TMX and Excel. You will find more details in [our documentation](http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Memsource_Cloud_User_Manual#Translation_Memory_Import), especially as regards metadata.
</td>
</tr>
<tr >

<td width="376" >Can we make the recording available to our students if they are interested?
</td>

<td width="376" >I don’t think GoToWebinar will make it possible for you to download the video. You need to be registered in order to be able to watch it. Offer students PM and linguist webinar recordings from the list: [/webinars/](/webinars/)
</td>
</tr>
<tr >

<td width="376" >Can the filters be accessed via API?
</td>

<td width="376" >No, not at the moment.
</td>
</tr>
<tr >

<td width="376" >Can you change and apply same settings to several people at once?
</td>

<td width="376" >If you mean project filters, then no, these need to be created by each project manager.
</td>
</tr>
<tr >

<td width="376" >We process over 150 languages. Is the Language column capable of displaying so many at one time?
</td>

<td width="376" >Do you mean 150 languages in one project? Technically, this should be possible, though I have never seen it in real life J.
</td>
</tr>
<tr >

<td width="376" >Regarding penalization – how exactly do you set it up, how can I give higher priority to one of my TMs.
</td>

<td width="376" >In order to give priority to one TM, you need to penalize other TMs. You can set penalties in you click on Select under Translation Memories in your project.
</td>
</tr>
<tr >

<td width="376" >Regarding the assignment of TMs to projects – why when you click on Select TM, you do not see anything under the Client column?
</td>

<td width="376" >Metadata are arbitrary. You can select some values or leave the fields empty. Of course, it is better to work with metadata as these help you match individual resources (translation memories, term bases and linguist/vendor users) to translation files.
</td>
</tr>
<tr >

<td width="376" >Is it possible to modify the workflow after its creation? For example, if I need to add a second review after the first one is finished.
</td>

<td width="376" >Yes, this is possible. Just click on Edit in your project and scroll down to Workflow Steps. There is one important limitation, though: if you initially select steps 1 and 3 out of your 5 workflow steps, you will later on be able to add steps 4 and 5, but not 2. Step 2 will be greyed out. So you cannot add any steps in between previously selected steps.

### Questions and answers from the webinar from March 17


<table cellpadding="9" width="752" cellspacing="0" > 
<tbody >
<tr valign="top" >

<td bgcolor="#ffffff" width="359" >If it is possible to import .txt files to the TM, and If it possible to export the current TM?
</td>

<td width="355" >It is only possible to import/export from TMX and MS Excel. TXT can be easily converted to a two-column Excel file.
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top" >

<td bgcolor="#ffffff" width="359" >One additional question regarding work with Tags. As we mostly work with languages where we really need sometimes to change the word order during translation - it there an option, when we have, for example, two or more tag pairs in one segment and we really need to insert first the second tag pair at the start of the translated segment and only after it we will insert the second (according to the source language) one. 
</td>

<td width="355" >Yes, you can reorder tags. Pressing F8 inserts tags in the 1, 2, 3, 4 … order, but you can manually copy&paste tags to any position in the segments.
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top" >

<td bgcolor="#ffffff" width="359" >Spellcheck does not allow to introduce a new term so it will not be mark as a mistake in future projects 
</td>

<td width="355" >It is possible to “ignore” words, and thus enter them in the user’s custom dictionary. Just right click on a term for which the spellchecker gives you a red underline.
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top" >

<td bgcolor="#ffffff" width="359" >How about linguist being able to see progress as remaining no match/partial match? Such statistics would be very helpful for monitoring progress of translation from linguist point of view.
</td>

<td width="355" >This is something we are working on.
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top" >

<td bgcolor="#ffffff" width="359" >In the section Pre-translate document there is no more MT pre-translation. Now I cen se just Human pre-translate. Will you put back the MT option?
</td>

<td width="355" >This is because we do not support batch pre-translation for Microsoft with Feedback. This MT is only available for a segment-per-segment pre-translation. Please check our documentation.
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top" >

<td bgcolor="#ffffff" width="359" >As this is the 1st one I had a chance to join I'd like to ask for the link for previous seminar as well as link for registration for the futher ones. 
</td>

<td width="355" >Previous one

March 24

March 31
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top" >

<td bgcolor="#ffffff" width="359" >Do you have option for find&replace words through the document?
</td>

<td width="355" >Yes, and this feature is one of the examples where Memsource Editor (desktop) and Memsource Web Editor differ slightly. In the desktop editor, you just press CTRL+H like in MS Word. In the web editor, you need to first use the filter to locate the string you want to replace, and then you will see a new “replace” item appear below the filter.
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top" >

<td bgcolor="#ffffff" width="359" >Do you have plans to introduce adding non-translatables (e.g. brand names) to avoid adding them to the term base?
</td>

<td width="355" >This option is already available. Please check file import settings.
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top" >

<td bgcolor="#ffffff" width="359" >Would you be able to introduce adding multiple terms for a single source term at the same time, instead of just one by one?
</td>

<td width="355" >This can be done from the web-based term base editor. Please open the term base from your project and you will see a plus sign next to each term, which allows you to enter synonyms.
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top" >

<td bgcolor="#ffffff" width="359" >Bilingual docx - do I have to import the file on the same workflow step as I exported from? Can I risk overwriting the translation from translation step with the reviewed translation for
</td>

<td width="355" >Yes, the bilingual docx will always go to the same workflow step from which it was downloaded.
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top" >

<td bgcolor="#ffffff" width="359" >I want to make sure that when you re-import the file from a bilingual docx, does the file name need to be exactly the same as the name of the exported file?
</td>

<td width="355" >No, the file name does not matter. What matters is the ID code in the header of the MS Word file.
