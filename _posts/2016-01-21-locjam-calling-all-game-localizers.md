**Are you a game localization company looking for new talents? Or a freelance localizer looking for a challenge? From February on, keep an eye on the** [**LocJam website**](http://www.locjam.org/)**.**<!--more-->

# <span style="font-weight: 400;">No Easy Task</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Game localizers must have the imaginative and linguistic skills necessary to help gamers cross the imaginary borders into new imaginary worlds. At the same time, they need to have a good knowledge of multimedia and software localization. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To complicate things even further, game localization is often done against short deadlines as well as a lack of context and visuals.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To this we can add &#8211; in the case of online games &#8211; the plot being developed as the game progresses, based on the requests and choices of the gamers themselves. Online games can be as simple as </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Candy Crush</span>](http://candycrushsaga.com/) <span style="font-weight: 400;">or as complex as </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">SimCity</span>](http://www.simcity.com/)<span style="font-weight: 400;">, but they are definitely not for the faint-hearted.</span>

# <span style="font-weight: 400;">Suspension of Disbelief Through Quality Assurance</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A semblance of reality is also essential in game localization. Consistency of language and terminology within the game helps strengthen the sense of being in another world. For this reason, quality assurance is fundamental.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Quality assurance is based on solid, lean processes. It requires tools that are efficient, comprehensive and sophisticated, without being too complicated. To guarantee consistency in all elements of a game, termbases and translation memories updated in real-time within a collaborative platform are a must. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, whether you are a rookie translator with a passion for games, an experienced translator looking for a new challenge, or a localization company in need of new talents, where do you start looking?</span>

# <span style="font-weight: 400;">Everywhere You Are… Start LocJammin’</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2013, the </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">LocJam contest</span>](http://www.locjam.org/) <span style="font-weight: 400;">is a nonprofit initiative aimed at spreading the word about game localization. The format is simple: For ten days, game localizers &#8211; both professionals and amateurs &#8211; can submit their version of a game through the </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">LocJam website</span>](http://www.locjam.org/)<span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can simply participate online or join one of the in-person workshops that are organized all over the world by expert localizers. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The source language is English and the organization accepts translations into French, German, Italian, Japanese, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian, European Spanish and Latin American Spanish.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Backstage some of the largest game localization agencies (of the caliber of </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Binari Sonori</span>](http://www.binarisonori.com/index.php) <span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Keywords Studio</span>](http://www.keywordsstudios.com/)<span style="font-weight: 400;">) will volunteer to review the translations &#8211; in anonymous form &#8211; and then pick winners among the professional and amateur participants.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The first edition in 2014 saw some 511 participants; for the second edition, in 2015, 623 people registered. According to </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Alain Dellepiane</span>](http://www.localization.it/)<span style="font-weight: 400;">, an Italian game localizer living in Tokyo and initiator of the LocJam contest on behalf of the</span>[ <span style="font-weight: 400;">IGDA </span>](http://www.igda.org/members/group_content_view.asp?group=121045&id=450710)<span style="font-weight: 400;">Localization SIG, this year’s edition could see over 800 participants. But we are ready to up the ante and say 1,000. </span>

# <span style="font-weight: 400;">A Win-Win Situation</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As said before, participation is free and there are no actual prizes &#8211; no money or trophies. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The game that the participants are required to translate has no commercial value: It has never been translated or sold before and it will never be sold in any form whatsoever. The same goes for the participants’ work: Translations won’t be sold and/or reused in any way.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And yet, at LocJam everybody is a winner. The participants get to test their knowledge and make their skills shine, while the game localization companies have a chance to discover fresh talents &#8211; besides identifying new trends. Visibility all around.</span>

# <span style="font-weight: 400;">And Tech Providers?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, there is no place for a commercial translation technology platform within the contest. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The LocJam organizers do not accept sponsoring from translation technology providers. In fact, usually, in their daily routine, game localizers use a variety of tools, from something very simple, like an Excel spreadsheet, to something more complex, like a collaborative translation platform. Just to give an example: Last year participants were asked to use </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Twine</span>](http://twinery.org/)<span style="font-weight: 400;">, an open-source tool. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, the choice of a specific translation tool would imply some kind of endorsement and the contest organizers prefer to refrain from this. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Is there any translation technology provider out there willing to pick up the gauntlet? All bets are on.</span>
