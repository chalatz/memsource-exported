“We use Memsource as the main translation management system for a well-known group of professional audio brands. <!--more-->Memsource is used for the translation of product manuals, press releases and other marketing literature, and it has surpassed all expectations. It is reliable, supports many formats, and the team continue to add new features. The interface is intuitive, and due to the flat learning curve we can quickly add translators to our team. The TMS landscape has changed a lot since we started working with Memsource – but we would definitely choose it again.”
