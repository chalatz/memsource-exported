Previously in Memsource, [workflow steps](https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003484032-Workflow) could only move forward. If a revision by the translator was needed after a reviewer made changes to the text, there would typically be another subsequent workflow step for that (i.e. Translation – Revision – Translator's Revision). From now on, **BIZ Team, BIZ Ultimate and Unlimited** edition users can benefit from the **Reject Job** feature.

Admins and Project managers can enable the Reject Job option for individual linguists upon creation or when editing them. Linguist users that have this option selected will have the functionality enabled. When they accept a job, they will be able to assess the quality of the translation without making any changes to the text. If they think the quality isn't good enough, they can change the job status to **Rejected by Linguist** and send it back to the translator for re-translation. The linguist in the previous workflow step automatically receives [Job Rejected](https://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Job_Rejected_Email_Template) notification and the job status is automatically changed from Completed to Emailed.

Please, keep in mind that changes from a higher workflow step aren't automatically propagated to lower workflow step. If a proofreader makes changes in Revision step and then sends the job back to the Translation step, the translator will need to [filter the changes](http://take.ms/KeLiv) in the editor and insert them manually.
