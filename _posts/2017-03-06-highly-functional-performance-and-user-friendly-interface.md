Memsource gives this opportunity to our students._” says **Yurii Zablotskyi**, Postgraduate Translation Lecturer at the Faculty of Romance and Germanic Languages at the** National University of Ostroh Academy**, Ukraine.

Yurii leads a translation internship program, where he offers students the opportunity to work with a number of different translation tools, including Memsource. Here are some further insights into his experience with Memsource:

<!--more-->

Memsource was firstly introduced to our faculty for the translation internship purpose. The aim of the course for students is to translate a certain volume of text, but they are free to choose how they do it and what tools they use. That means we only suggest Memsource as one of the options. Initially, the course was not compulsory.

Frankly, I didn&#8217;t expect that so many students would show their interest in the course. I had to quickly find additional materials to assign tasks to everyone. At this point, some of my colleagues volunteered to help me supervise the project.

As a first step we organized a series of meetings to explain how Memsource works and how the translation process is organized. Then I enrolled some of the students into the program and assigned tasks for them. Soon after, more students asked to join and as a result, we now have 15 fourth-year students doing their bachelor&#8217;s degree and 2 instructors assisting me in the management of our translation internship project. In less then a month, nearly 60 third-year students will join our Academic Edition to study cloud-based CAT software.

All features of the product are very helpful, but one I like in particular is  having the ability to monitor the students&#8217; progress in real-time. I can nudge them and &#8220;wake them up&#8221; if they are working too slowly. Memsource combines highly functional performance and user-friendly interface. It wasn&#8217;t difficult to start working in the system; however, after attending some of the free Memsource training webinars, it became even easier.

To sum up, I am convinced that training translation students to become proficient users of CAT-tools will help them to acquire the necessary experience and skills to be more competitive on the translation market. Memsource gives this opportunity to our students.
