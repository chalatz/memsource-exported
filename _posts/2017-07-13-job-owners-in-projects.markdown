Every time a job is imported into Memsource Project, the Project Manager/Administrator who created it will be automatically set as its Job Owner. It would therefore be possible to distinguish who added specific jobs if multiple PMs collaborate on a single project.

Apart from only seeing who created the job inside the project, Job Owners can also receive notifications (in the same manner the Project Owner receives them) for any status change done to their jobs. This option needs to be enabled in Project Settings inÂ **Access&Security** section.
