The new **Target subfolder path** field will only be visible in the **Create Automated Project Settings** when configuring APC with a supported connector. The following connectors are supported: FTP, SFTP, Dropbox, Google Drive, Box, OneDrive, Git, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket Cloud.

See [this](https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003460931-How-to-setup-and-use-the-Automated-Project-Creation) article on Automated Project Creation in Memsource.



In addition, when a connector used as part of APC detects three or more instances in a row of a project not being created when it should be, an email notification will be sent to the affected Memsource users.
