We have added more options to the Analyze feature.

Users can now decide whether the post-editing analysis should include data about the changes that have been made to non-translatables and machine translation suggestions.<!-- more -->

Previously, it was only possible to select whether or not changes to translation memory suggestions appeared in the post-editing analysis results.

The analysis settings can be accessed via Setup or within a project when **Analyze **is selected. The post-editing analysis should only be run once a translation job is completed.

To find out more, see our [Post-editing Analysis](https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003942912) article.
