“It is the perfect solution for us since we are doing both in-house translations as well as using external vendors. Without having to invest in a server solution, we are now able to work on the same platform and share our TMs and TBs with our vendors. Memsouce is a very user-friendly translation tool and the support is fast and very professional. I highly recommend that you try out the tool, you will not be disappointed. I am convinced that cloud-based systems are the future for the translation industry.”
