**Nihon iPrism** <span style="font-weight: 400;">is a translation company based in Hyderabad, India, that offers Japanese-to-English translation services across various industries, with a focus on the industrial, legal, medical and pharmaceutical fields.</span>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">When choosing Memsource, Nihon iPrism set to achieve </span><b>two major goals</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span>
</p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Increase productivity</strong> by better leveraging translated content </span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Improve collaboration</strong> among in-house staff and vendors.</span>
</li>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Nihon iPrism found an all-encompassing solution in Memsource Cloud. </span>

## **Productivity boost**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After running 200 projects in Memsource Cloud, Nihon iPrism has witnessed a </span>**productivity increase of up to 50%** **as well as a cost saving of up to 20% for its customers.** 

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Nihon iPrism’s (project) teams can now maintain translation memories and glossaries in real time and share them among all the team members. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As the majority of the company’s translation projects come from industrial fields and have a high percentage of repetitions &#8211; as well as domain-specific terminology &#8211; Nihon iPrism can leverage on its language resources to significantly boost its productivity.</span>

## **Collaboration across the team**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Together with Memsource translation management tools, </span>**translation memories and terminology databases are fully integrated in the workflow** <span style="font-weight: 400;">and contribute to consistency within one specific translation job as well as through every localization project of every single customer. </span>

Nihon iPrism’s team has also benefited from another core element of Memsource Cloud &#8211; **Memsource Editor**. This web-based editor is seamlessly connected to translation memories and termbases allowing, therefore, linguists to conduct quick searches and leverage on the linguistic data.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Memsource Editor is easy-to-use and presents a </span><b>short learning curve</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Nihon iPrism’s translation professionals. This short learning curve translates, in turn, into </span><b>less training costs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the company and a </span><b>quick productivity increase</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the language professionals.</span>
