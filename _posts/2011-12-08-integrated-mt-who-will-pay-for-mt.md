**Memsource has announced its integration of  Google MT** **APIv2****.**

Memsource now supports the APIv2 version of Google machine translation. In order to make use of the machine translation resources provided by Google, it is necessary to create an account with Google, edit billing details and use the unique API code created from within the account. [Click here](http://youtu.be/-KHq094SeWU) for more instructions.<!--more-->

An interesting issue can now be raised as to who is supposed to pay for the MT resources. We in Memsource believe that the cost of MT should be covered by the job owner, i.e. those who run the server and create and distribute jobs. On the other hand, there is an opportunity for creating a scheme where the use of MT will be combined with our **[post-editing analysis](http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Post-editing_Analysis).** Under this scheme, the cost of MT will be covered by an LSP assigning translations to a freelancer. In return for this value, it is  possible to use the post-editing analysis to arrange for a system of discounts on machine translation hits that translators do not edit and use directly as suggested by the MT engine. This is in line with our idea of creating a workflow where [MT can in a certain way be treated as TM](/download-why-not-treat-mt-as-tm-memsource-case-study-presented-at-locworld/).

This certainly is an issue that will raise a lot of discussion.
