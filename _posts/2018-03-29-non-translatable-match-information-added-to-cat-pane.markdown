[![](/uploads/2018/03/Indication-of-NTs-CAT-Pane.png)](/uploads/2018/03/Indication-of-NTs-CAT-Pane.png)Users will now be able to see the origin of an NT match in the CAT pane. 

<!-- more -->

Originally, this information was only available in the tool tip that appears when a user hovers over the NT match. The position of this information is outlined in the screenshot.

An NT match can either be rule-based or AI-based. If an NT match is rule-based that means our system has recognized the segment as matching a certain rule. Rule-based NT matches are typically numbers or combinations of characters which aren't recognized as words. If a match is AI-based it means that the segment matches our AI model. The AI model can identify more types of NTs.
