<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a new option in the HTML file import settings which allows users to decide whether or not standalone comments (those not within paragraphs) are imported into Memsource as tags.</span>

<!--more-->

The option is selected by default. Inline comments (those within paragraphs) will still be imported as tags. The new option can be deselected in the HTML section of the File Import Settings.
