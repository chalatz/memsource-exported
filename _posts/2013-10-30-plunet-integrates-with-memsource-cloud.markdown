Berlin/Prague – October 2013 - With the latest integration of Memsource Cloud, Plunet has further expanded its market-leading offering of dynamic CAT tool interfaces. Highly sophisticated CAT tool integrations in Plunet allow the automated management of production and business processes directly via the Plunet BusinessManager platform.<!-- more --> Translation agencies and language service providers utilizing Plunet in conjunction with Memsource can now manage all processes more efficiently and optimize their own competitive edge in terms of technology long-term.

Entire translation projects can now be created, analyzed and controlled for Memsource directly via Plunet. The new interface offers project managers some distinctive advantages in comparison with traditional workflows without an integrated TMS-CAT management solution. With the integration of a Memsource interface in Plunet BusinessManager, automated quote and order calculations are now just the click of a button away. Seamless workflow management processes will now make the time-consuming back and forth between Plunet and the translation software obsolete, while cross-system synchronization of internal and external resources facilitates their quick selection for relevant jobs. The integration furthermore ensures more efficient handling of project files and their automated delivery.

The Memsource interface will be available as an add-on for Plunet BusinessManager Version 5.6, which will be released shortly. Contact Plunet or Memsource for prices and a detailed overview of features.
