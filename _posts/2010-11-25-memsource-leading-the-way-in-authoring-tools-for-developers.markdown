Memsource with its authoring tools for software developers received great responseÂ at [Tekom](/blog/visit-us-at-tekom-booth-411/). Right now we are really busy, pursuing the multitude of new opportunities that appeared as a result of our presence at Tekom.

Apart from being the only commercially-available authoring system for software developers, the Memsource solution for text strings is valued highly for its simple and straight-forward approach. **No rules** **need to be written**, no terminology or synonyms need to be defined. Memsource simply connects to the existing corporate resource such as a translation memory or simply a database of text strings. Moreover, Memsource works in a real-time mode and so developers get instant feedback on the text strings they are writing in their source code editor.
