The list of Memsource Connectors has been expanded by addition of OneDrive, GitLab and Zendesk.

Users working with MS Office suite and storing their documents on the OneDrive repository can now draw content directly from the server instead of downloading them first (similar to Google Drive).

The set of Git connectors (Git and Github) has also been extended and how provides connector to GitLab.

Zendesk connector allows companies providing customer support to directly tap into their knowledge base and localize articles either in real time or gradually through manual import. Exporting the translated content can then be directly published and available to speakers of the secondary languages.
