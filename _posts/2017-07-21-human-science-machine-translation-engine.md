The Human Science machine translation engine has been added to the list of MT engines integrated with Memsource.

Similar to the other engines, gaining access is possible only after receiving appropriate credentials from the [official site](http://www.science.co.jp/english/index.html) of this engine.

Insert these credentials into yourÂ **Machine Translation Engines** to establish the connection.
