**Years of experience in the translation industry**: 15+

**Years of experience as Memsource user**: 4<!--more-->

**Why did you choose to become Memsource Certified Trainer?** I have a solid experience with different CAT tools, e.g. Déjà Vu, Transit, Trados. However, in my opinion, Memsource is well ahead of them all in terms of user friendliness and ease of operation. It has an intuitive interface, it is very easy to learn and offers ample opportunities for translators, editors, trainers, managers and even direct customers.

**In which language(s) will you give a Memsource training?** Russian and English

**What activities are you developing &#8211; or have developed &#8211; as Memsource Certified Trainer?** My company  regularly holds thematic workshops and training courses for our new interpreters/freelancers (for example, conferences via web or on premises), reps of our customers etc., to help them get acquainted with new Memsource features and tools.

**What kind of audience do you plan to train/are you training?** Freelancers, managers of our clients, especially folks from translation departments etc.

**Which are the most useful Memsource functionalities for your work?** Automation of translator’s job assignments and user friendliness (normally we need only a 30-minute training session to teach newcomers how to work with Memsource); all the features that allow to share complex tasks at different levels (for example, our editors may work in parallel with translators to deal with short deadlines); well-designed translation memory and termbase management as well as QA tools (to ensure full compliance with terminological requirements regardless of the number of translators and editors involved in the project).

**What do you like most about Memsource?** Memsource is like an AKM-Kalashnikov rifle – fail-safe, easy-to-use and well ahead of the others to get the job done. I would like to thank the Memsource team for their great job, and wish them further development and good luck.
