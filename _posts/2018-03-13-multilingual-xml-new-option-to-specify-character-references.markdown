[![](https://www.memsource.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/MultilingualXML-Settings-Characterentities.png)](https://www.memsource.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/MultilingualXML-Settings-Characterentities.png)A new field has been added to the Multilingual XML Import Settings which allows users to specify what the character references should be for different characters in the exported XML file.

For example, if a user wants quotes “ represented as  &quot, this would need to be specified in the Convert to character entities field.

This field is already available in the XML Import Settings. To find out more about working with Multilingual XML files in Memsource, see [our Help Center](https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001483592-Multilingual-XML).
