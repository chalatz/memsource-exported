They subscribed to the Memsource Enterprise edition to carry out on-going multi-language projects with short turnaround times. Tetsuya Honda, the Lead Localization Planner, has provided the following customer testimonial:

“For our long-term projects, it was necessary to establish a reliable and accessible workspace. Our localization group includes both in-house and external project managers and translators, and that’s why we chose Memsource: to share resources across the whole team.”

  * Workspace and data sharing with external team members;
  * The ability to instantly create and share jobs from existing Word/Excel files;
  * Real-time task monitoring;
  * On-the-fly coordination and guidance.
