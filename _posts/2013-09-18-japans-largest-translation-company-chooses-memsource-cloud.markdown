[Honyaku Center](http://www.honyakuctren.com/), founded in 1986, is Japan’s largest translation company with offices in Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya and subsidiaries in the USA and China. Honyaku Center has been listed on the Osaka Securities Exchange since 2006.<!-- more -->

Honyaku Center has subscribed to Memsource Cloud in 2011. After several months of thorough testing and pilot projects it has made a strategic decision to gradually deploy Memsource in its translation operation.

**Hiroki Kawano**, Deputy General Manager at Honyaku Center, has commented:

**_“Over the past year we have rolled out Memsource to most of our project managers as well as freelancers. We have chosen Memsource because it delivers on the promise of user-friendliness but at the same time offers the required functionality. So far we have been very happy with the decision to migrate to MemSource. Not just with the software itself but also with the overall support we receive from the Memsource team. Specifically, the speed at which Memsource engineers can respond to some of our requests is admirable. It is not exceptional that we see some of our requirements go live into production in less than a week.”_**
