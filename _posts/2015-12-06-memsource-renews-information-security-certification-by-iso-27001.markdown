Memsource Cloud has been audited by an independent security consultancy. Following the audit, the application has successfully renewed the information security management system certification according to ISO/IEC 27001:2013 standard.

These audits take place every 12 months.

The ISO 27001 certification confirms that Memsource has a system in place to protect the user data. That includes team roles and responsibilities, support, security objectives, and a risk management and treatment process.
