Memsource has introduced support for QuarkXPress file formats.

QuarkXPress is a tool for creating and editing simple or complex pages in a WYSIWYG environment. Out of all the possible file formats the tool can generate, the TAG and XTG file are currently supported (since these are the formats containing translatable text).

The import settings for Quark Tag files allow for removal of kerning and tracking tags.
