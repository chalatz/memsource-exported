Users manually uploading documents from their Git repositories can now easily identify content that has been changed or added in the last commit. When browsing through various branches of your repository, Memsource will notify you if there are files that underwent such a change and also allows you to easily display them through theÂ <span style="text-decoration: underline;">show</span> button.
