The desktop Memsource Editor is now available with a real-time in-context preview for Microsoft Word, HTML, XML with XSL template andÂ  DITA files. The in-context preview allows translators to preview the translation in its native format with real-time changes while translating. This eliminates the need to download the original or translated document separately and provides an instant context for the segments currently being translated.
