  <strong>What Do Translation Buyers Expect from LSPs in 2016?</strong>
</p>

&nbsp;

Requirements for translation buyers are changing fast.

Quality is not enough anymore. Enterprises want a transparent production workflow and an easy e-commerce-like procurement process. Translation companies need to meet these requirements or they will be forced into price-only competition.

Do you agree?
