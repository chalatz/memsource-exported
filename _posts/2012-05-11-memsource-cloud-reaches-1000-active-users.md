[Memsource Cloud](http://www.memsource.com/) has reached an important milestone this week: 1000 users. And these are just users in Memsource Cloud, on top there are users that have licensed Memsource Server.<!--more-->

This is a brief Memsource history:

  * January 2011: First beta users
  * Summer of 2011: First paying customers
  * Spring of 2012: 1000 users

The 1000 user milestone is really reassuring for us, we will keep working hard on growing and improving MemSource. And we have a lot of new things coming this year.
