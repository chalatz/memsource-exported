Memsource held its first User Meetup on March 22, 2015, just before the GALA conference in Seville. Representatives from over 25 translation companies that already use, or plan to use, Memsource attended this event. Attendees networked with one another and exchanged contacts for future collaboration on multilingual projects.<!-- more -->
