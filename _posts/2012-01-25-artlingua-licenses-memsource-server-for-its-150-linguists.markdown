[Artlingua](http://www.artlingua.cz/index.php?lang=en), one of the leading Central European translation agencies with over 20 years of history has licensed Memsource Server to cover its translation technology needs.<!-- more -->

Artlingua Chair of the Board, Jana Chaloupecka, said: "**After carefully assessing the available server-based CAT software, we decided to go with MemSource. This was after an extended period of evaluation and testing. The team at Memsource has developed translation software that is user-friendly but also delivers on the promise of powerful features and robust performance. Last but not least, the translator's workbench is available as a free download, which makes the adoption so much easier for our translators.**"

Memsource Server is a complete translation environment,Â which includes translation memory, terminology management, machine translation and translation workflow. Memsource translator's workbench, Memsource Editor, connects seamlessly to Memsource Server and is available as a [free download](http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/MemSource_Editor_Installation).
