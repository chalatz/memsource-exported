Six stadium-sized halls were packed with the very latest developments in gaming technology, along with incredible displays, trial booths, blaring music and live stage-shows.

Gamescom 2016 took place from the 17th to the 21st of August, and we were on-site speaking to industry insiders, as well as documenting the usual chaos and festivity.
