GALA, the Globalization and Localization Association, will hold its annual conference in Lisbon from 28 to 30 March 2011. Memsource will be participating and showing off its authoring and translation products at a booth there.<!--more-->

The Iberian peninsula seems this year&#8217;s favorite for the language industry events as the 2011 Localization World conference will take place in Barcelona. We will be there just as well.
