<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ciklopea has been using Memsource since late 2015 and started using the <a href="https://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/WordPress_Plugin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WordPress connector</a> in the spring of 2017 to translate WordPress websites for their clients. Since then, the team has found they are able to produce faster turnaround times for their clients while maintaining quality and real-time oversight.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Marina Orešković, Chief Operations Officer, &#8220;The automated process of WordPress-based website localization through WPML and the Memsource WordPress connector enables us to set up website localization projects 50% faster, preserve the integrity of the online content across the localized versions, and check the localized content for any issues in near real time.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, our process is leaner, enabling our clients to publish the localized websites up to 30% faster than before.”</span>
