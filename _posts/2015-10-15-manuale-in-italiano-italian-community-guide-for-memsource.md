Students of Civica scuola interpreti e traduttori di Milano have created an Italian version of the Memsource documentation. Italian translators and project managers can now train and look for reference materials in their native language.

The community manual has 40 pages, and it can be downloaded from the school&#8217;s website in PDF format. The documentation was completed in mid-2015, and it will remain up-to-date for several months.

Second-year students studying for a Master&#8217;s degree in Translation at Milan School of Translators and Interpreters created this manual in their 2014-2015 academic year. They used CAT-tools and worked as a team with roles and responsibilities of translators, terminologists and project managers. Students localized online Memsource manuals in their original mediawiki format, and later they used the existing translation memory to create a PDF document. This academic project emulated real work experience.

The Memsource team would like to thank the students and professors responsible for this great initiative. This is the best way to make education more practical, and to prepare students for their future jobs.
