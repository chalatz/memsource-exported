David Canek, the CEO at Memsource along with the staff would like to express sincere thanks to the students of Istanbul [Yeni Yuzyil University](http://www.yeniyuzyil.edu.tr/) who participated in the translation. This is a community localization project. It started in March 2015 and after the translation of the initial batch, regular updates will follow for each coming version of Memsource.

In addition to the English version, Memsource Cloud is currently available in 10 other languages: Chinese, Czech, German, Greek, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, Slovak, Spanish and Turkish.
