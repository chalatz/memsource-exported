For Project Managers, the mobile app allows them to easily create new jobs, select desired settings, assign translators and due dates, and monitor the progress of all projects, without needing to boot up a computer. Resources like translation memories and term bases can be assigned to projects and users can filter projects to find specific clients or project names. With the mobile app, project managers can easily respond to urgent client requests, have an overview of projects in progress, and see which jobs are overdue.

Translators can also accept translation jobs on the go through the mobile app. After receiving an email notification about a new job, simply open the app, and change the Job Status to “Accepted”.
