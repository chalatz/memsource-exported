A new version of [Memsource Connector for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/memsource-connector/) has been launched.

In version 1.2, you can decide which content will be translated and whether Memsource should look for draft articles or published ones. The plugin also lets you choose whether posts that are uploaded back to your WordPress site after translation should be saved drafts or automatically published.
