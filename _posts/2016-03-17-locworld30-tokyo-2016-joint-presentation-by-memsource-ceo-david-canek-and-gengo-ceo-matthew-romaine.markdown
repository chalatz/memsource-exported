The presentation - **Technology For The Crowd in The Cloud **- will describe the challenges faced by cloud-based companies when attempting to marry innovation with tradition.

Gengo is a leading player in the crowdsourced translation space. It turned translation provided by lay translators into a professional service. Gengo’s technology developed as an alternative and often in opposition to the established paradigms of the TMS or CAT tools. As its customer base grew, requests to support more traditional approaches intensified. In 2015, Gengo integrated Memsource translation memory service, provided over the [Memsource API](http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Memsource_API).



**Technology For The Crowd in The Cloud**

Friday, April 15, 2016, 2:00pm – 2:45pm
