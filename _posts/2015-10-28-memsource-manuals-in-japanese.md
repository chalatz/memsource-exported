Two manuals in Japanese, one for project managers and one for linguists, are now available for download in PDF. These manuals serve as reference materials and getting started guides for new users.

The manual for linguists covers accepting jobs, downloading the Memsource editor, translating and running QA checks. The project manager&#8217;s manual details project and job creation, analysis, setting up translation memory and termbases, batch file processing, working with fuzzy matches, pseudolocalization , job assignment and other basic project management functions.

Junko Kato, our trainer and consultant in Tokyo is the author of these two manuals.
