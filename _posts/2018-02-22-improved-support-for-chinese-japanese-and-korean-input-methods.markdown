We have improved the way in which Memsource Web Editor supports the major Chinese, Japanese, and Korean input languages.

<!-- more -->

The Web Editor now fully supports the following input methods: 

  * Chinese OS Default
  * Chinese Sogou
  * Japanese OS Default
  * Korean 2-beolsik

We have successfully tested the majority of default Input Method Editors (IMEs) provided by operating systems, including popular third-party IMEs, such as Sogou. 

The following gif shows a demonstration of Sogou being used in Memsource.
