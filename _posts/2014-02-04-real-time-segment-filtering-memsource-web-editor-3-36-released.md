Memsource Web Editor 3.36 has been released on Monday, 3 February 2014 at 1:30 PM GMT. This is a major release that introduces state-of-the-art search/filtering features that display results in real time, as you type.<!--more-->

As you may note, the current version of the Web Editor is still beta. Before dropping the beta label we still want to introduce some additional improvements. It should take about 2 months to complete this and as a result, users should experience much higher editing comfort as well as editing speed in all supported browsers (Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari&#8230;) and not just in Chrome.

Below is an overview of the most important features brought to you by Memsource Web Editor 3.36:

### Real-time Find and Replace

  * Find 
      * The find feature has been completely revamped, providing results literally as you type
      * Enter the text you want to find into the source and/or target text filter fields and the segments containing the entered text will be displayed in real time
      * Highlighting the found text did not make it into this release but it is coming soon (in our next release)

  * Replace 
      * The replace feature has also been completely redesigned
      * The replace feature becomes available, only once some text gets filtered

### Real-time Segment Status Filter

  * This version introduces a new real-time segment status filter (almost identical to the one that is available in Memsource Editor)
  * Users can filter by: 
      * Segment status
      * Pre-translation origin
      * Created by / Modified by

### Real-time Segment Sorting

  * This version introduces a new real-time segment sorting (just like the one available in Memsource Editor)
  * Users can sort source segments by: 
      * A to Z
      * Z to A
      * Shortest first
      * Longest first
      * Least repetitions
      * Most repetitions

### Usability

  * Select All 
      * The Select All (Ctrl+Shift+A) feature has been available for some time but now it has also been added to the Edit menu

  * Preferences 
      * The new Preferences menu (located under Tools) provides a number of useful user settings for: 
          * Pre-translate
          * Appearance
