The Subscription page has gone through a major redesign in order to provider better and more streamlined user experience while retaining all the previous functions.

In **Setup** you can now find **Details** button in the **Subscription **section. This will lead you to the overview of your subscription as well as options to:

  * Upgrade edition
  * Add users
  * Extend subscription

The section will also contain the information on the remaining subscription period, chosen Project Storage time and your past Invoices.[<img class="aligncenter wp-image-15072 size-full" src="http://www.memsource.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/New-Subscription-page.png" alt="" width="753" height="480" data-id="15072" />](http://www.memsource.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/New-Subscription-page.png)
