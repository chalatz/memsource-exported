Photoshop and Markdown files can now be processed in Memsource.

Adobe Photoshop **.psd** files can be imported and automatically recognized and processed as a supported file format.

The supported extensions for Markdown are both **.md** and **.markdown**. For Markdown files, the import settings can also be adjusted to achieve the desired import/export results.
