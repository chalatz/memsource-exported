Memsource 6.10 brings new webhook trigger as well as an update to the JSON datastructure.

Webhook, an arbitrary URL which can handle HTTP POST requests, can now receive 3 event notifications from Memsource Cloud:

  * Job Created
  * Job Assigned
  * Job Status Changed

The JSON data structure has also been updated in order to pride additional information about the event.

For more information, you can visit dedicated pages on our <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003695152-Webhooks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Support Center</a> or in our <a href="http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Memsource_API#Webhooks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">User Manual</a>.
