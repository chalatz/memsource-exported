We have already [shared some basic information](/memsource-xliff-editor-first-impressions/) on our new translator&#8217;s workbench, the Memsource XLIFF Editor, which we are going to release towards the end of this year.

There are high expectations that we and our customers have from it. This brand new workbench will be multiplatform, so it will run not just on Windows but also on Macintosh and Linux machines.<!--more-->
