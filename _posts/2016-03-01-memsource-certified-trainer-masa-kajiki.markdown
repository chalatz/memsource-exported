Last year we launched our [Memsource Certified Trainers Program](/memsource-certified-trainer-program/) and we were overwhelmed  - and extremely pleased - by the number of applications received. **Ten participants have already passed the test** and are now officially **Memsource Certified Trainers**. Others will start the training program soon.

For those of you who are still thinking whether to join the program, watch this space: We will announce a new training program in the fall.

As of today, we will start introducing the new certified trainers to the Memsource community. Here is the first interview.

**Masa Kajiki**, Founder and CEO of **[MK Translation Firm](http://www.mktranslationfirm.com/)**


**Years of experience in the translation industry**: 15.

**Years of experience as Memsource user**: Since 2011.

**Why did you choose to become Memsource Certified Trainer?** Because I would like to spread Memsource across Japan.

**In which language(s) will you give a Memsource training?** Japanese.

**What activities are you developing - or have developed - as Memsource Certified Trainer? **In the past, I held a presentation on Memsource, together with Josef Kubovsky, at the Translation Festival organized by the [Japan Translation Federation](http://www.jtf.jp/english/) (JTF) in Tokyo, in 2013 and 2014.

During the first Memsource appearance at the festival, our in-house translator acted as interpreter for David Čaněk’s speech. I also appeared in [one of the Memsource webinars in Japanese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwa8B9xRd-c) and organized a Memsource seminar in Osaka.

In the future, I plan to organize a Memsource seminar in the Western region of Japan.

**What kind of audience do you plan to train/are you training? **I will start by training our in-house staff and our registered freelance translators. In the near future, I will train translation school students.  On request, I will be happy to train corporate clients.

**Which are the most useful Memsource functionalities for your work? **The most useful functionality is the possibility of [creating various workflow steps](http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Memsource_Cloud_User_Manual#Workflow_Steps).

**What do you like most about Memsource? **What I like most is that Memsource is cloud-based, so that data is always up to date.

**Anything else you would like to share with us? **MK Translation Firm is the first agency to adopt Memsource in Japan.  I am probably the first Japanese person to adopt Memsource.
