Memsource Cloud 2.4 was released on 3 September 2012. Read more about the new features below or watch a [recording of a Memsource webinar](http://youtu.be/bBX8O0FTgXA) that provided an overview of the new features (the 2.4 release includes over 100 improvements and bug fixes).<!--more-->

## First, an Important UI Change

  * Introducing inactive menu buttons: 
      * Until you select a file in your project, menu buttons (such as Download, Pre-translate, etc.) will be displayed as inactive (since we do not know to which file you want to apply that action). After selecting a file, the buttons will become active, so that you can download, analyze, pre-translate &#8230;  the selected file(s)<figure id="attachment_1111" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

## The New Features

  * Self-learning capability: Memsource will automatically suggest relevant linguists _(only in the Team edition)_ 
      * When assigning a job to a linguist, Memsource will suggest most relevant linguists automatically, based on the linguist&#8217;s previous jobs
      * The suggestion criteria can also be set and modified manually on the user&#8217;s detail page
  * Linguist users can be assigned [custom roles](http://support.memsource.com/topic/how-to-create-translator-reviewer-and-customer-validator-users), such as proofreader, editor, reviewer, checker, validator, post-editor, etc. _(only in the Team edition)_
  * Project managers and administrators can now create unlimited number of users and select which users will be active _(only in the Team edition)_<figure id="attachment_1115" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

  * Linguists can now access a project&#8217;s term base in the [linguist portal](http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Linguist_Portal) 
      * By default linguists may edit &#8220;new&#8221; (not approved) terms
      * A project manager or administrator may, in addition, allow specific linguists to &#8220;edit and delete approved terms&#8221;, effectively promoting that linguist user to a terminologist
      * If multiple term bases are selected for a project, only the one in the write mode is displayed to the linguist in the linguist portal
  * Unapproved terms (&#8220;new&#8221; terms) are now displayed in gray in Memsource Cloud, so that they can be easily distinguished from approved terms that are displayed in black color font
  * Different translation memories can be assigned to workflow steps in a project _(only in the Team edition)_ 
      * Previously, all workflow steps in a project had to share identical translation memories. Now it is possible to assign different translation memories to different workflow steps in a project
  * Alerting a user to the status of the preceding workflow step _(only in the Team edition)_ 
      * If a preceding workflow step has not yet been completed, the user is alerted to this fact &#8211; the indicator of the number of segments confirmed turns red and a message is displayed, e.g. &#8220;previous workflow step not completed (85% confirmed)&#8221;
  * For locked jobs, confirming a segment or uploading to server is blocked
  * Email templates allow defining a cc email address (e.g. to copy all communication to an email archive)
  * When editing multiple jobs at once, users can now decide which specific fields should be batch updated and which should be left intact (these can be removed)
  * Improved deployment process 
      * Minor Memsource releases (these are most frequent) get now deployed without any interruption to the Memsource Cloud service
  * New [API calls](http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/MemSource_API) have been added: 
      * [Project APIs](http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Project_API_v2)
      * [Job APIs](http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Job_API_v2)
