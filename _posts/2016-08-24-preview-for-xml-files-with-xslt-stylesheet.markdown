Memsource users working on XML files can now preview their translations in html view.



This new feature will be useful for checking translated text segments in context. For instance, it will show if text fits into boxes in the final layout.

To activate the preview, upload an XSLT stylesheet together with the XML file.

The import button is located under File Import settings for XML when you create a new job.

When you import an XML with a stylesheet (XSL or XSLT), the Preview Translation in Memsource Editor will generate an HTML preview instead of an XML one.

You can generate a HTML view at any time to check how your changes fit in the layout.
