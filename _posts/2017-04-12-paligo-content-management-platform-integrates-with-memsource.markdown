[Paligo](https://paligo.net/), a content authoring and management platform for technical documentation, has announced an integration with Memsource’s translation platform.<!-- more -->

The integration, currently in Beta, will allow technical writers and users of [Paligo’s Professional Edition and higher](https://paligo.net/pricing/) to connect their account to a Memsource account with just a few clicks. This allows documentation created in Paligo to be easily sent for translation to the desired agency or translators, and to receive the completed translations directly back in the Paligo system.

To set up the Paligo/Memsource integration, users must have accounts in both systems. To see step-by-step setup instructions, please watch our [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9kWL_6j6w4) or visit our documentation on the [Paligo Integration](https://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Paligo_integration).



The [Paligo team welcomes feedback](https://paligo.net/contact-2/) from their users with Memsource accounts to improve the integration and to understand which features are most useful in translating documentation.

**Don’t have an account with both systems?** Both Paligo and Memsource offer 30-day free trials and the integration is available in the trial accounts.
