**Users of the BIZ Ultimate and Ultimate Editions will now be able toÂ whitelabel the email address Memsource uses to send out notifications.**

Up to now, all emails were sent from a general email address (system@memsource.com), but with the release of Memsource 6.3, this email address can be whitelabelled so users of a specific organization can receive emails from their own, private domain.

This feature cannot be setup solely by users in their accounts. If you wish to setup your Custom Email, please contact support@memsource.com who will provide you with instructions on how to proceed.
