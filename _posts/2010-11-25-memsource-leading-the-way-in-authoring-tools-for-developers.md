    Memsource with its authoring tools for software developers received great responseÂ at <a href="/blog/visit-us-at-tekom-booth-411/">Tekom</a>. Right now we are really busy, pursuing the multitude of new opportunities that appeared as a result of our presence at Tekom.

    Apart from being the only commercially-available authoring system for software developers, the Memsource solution for text strings is valued highly for its simple and straight-forward approach. <strong>No rules</strong> <strong>need to be written</strong>, no terminology or synonyms need to be defined. Memsource simply connects to the existing corporate resource such as a translation memory or simply a database of text strings. Moreover, Memsource works in a real-time mode and so developers get instant feedback on the text strings they are writing in their source code editor.
