Memsource allows Administrators to define a range of IP addresses from which the Memsource Account can be accessed. Up until now, the limitation applied to all the users within a given organization.

However, it is now possible to choose this limitation only for Project Managers and Administrators. This means that if the option is selected, no IP address limitations will apply to the Linguists, Submitters or Guest users.

To gain access to this option, Administrators should use the **Setup &#8211; Access and Security **section.
