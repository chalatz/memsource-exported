Users are now able to set up a fully automated process through which:

  * Memsource will establish a connection with an online repository (Google Drive, Dropbox or FTP)
  * Memsource will check selected folders for new content, at defined time intervals
  * All newly detected files will be sent to an automatically created Memsource project
  * After the translations are finished, the files are sent back to the location from which they were retrieved

You will find more details [in our documentation](http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Automated_Project_Creation).
