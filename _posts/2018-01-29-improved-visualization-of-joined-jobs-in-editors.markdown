It is now easier to work with combined translation jobs (files) in Memsource Desktop Editor and Web Editor. Each job will be separated by a bar which displays the job’s number and filename (as they appear in Memsource Cloud).<!-- more -->

This is particularly useful in the following scenarios:

  * You have joined jobs together and want to visualize the jobs separately in the Editors. See the [joining files](https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003961951-Join-Files) article in our Help Center for more information.

  * You have split one job into multiple jobs and want to see them combined in the Editors but with the different jobs indicated. Learn more about [splitting files](https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000259451-Split-File) in our Help Center.
