It is possible to setup 2-factor authentication (also called 2 step authentication)to increase security of your user account. You account can be linked with Google Authenticator, Authy or other compatible application on your phone.
  
Once it is set, your account will be linked to the app on your phone. When you sign in to Memsource account, you will be prompt to provide your username, password and then also one of the numbers in your phone app.
  
More details can be found in our <a href="http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/2-factor_authentication" target="_blank">User manual.</a>

This feature is available for Cloud and Web Editor. Using it with desktop Memsource Editor will require version 6.200.0.
