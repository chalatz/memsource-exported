![](http://www.memsource.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Purchase-Order-number-225x300.png)It is now possible for users to fill in the Purchase Order number as an additional text field when creating or editing a project. Up until now, these numbers could only be inserted from an Automation Widget.

The Purchase Order numbers can also be displayedÂ in the Project overview or used when filtering for specific projects.
