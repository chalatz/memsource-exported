Memsource support hours now cover US day time. Katerina Benova, the first person on our support team, has relocated from Prague to Vancouver island in British Columbia, Canada. She will handle email requests from 8 am to 5 pm Pacific Daylight time.

Our European customers can too, now benefit from extended support hours. PDT hours translate into 17.00 pm - 02.00 am for Central European time. So that's good news for late night workers that keep translating and managing translations deep into the night.

The support team at Memsource currently numbers 5 people at 3 locations.

We are looking forward to hiring a full-time support manager in Japan.
