_This customer testimonial has been provided by Max Troyer, Assistant Professor at Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey._

The Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey offers one of the world’s top translation and localization programs, and has been using the Memsource Academic Edition since 2012. Translation & Localization Management students learn to integrate Memsource into the business environment, how to manage translation and localization projects, and how to use the system as linguists. In their translation courses, students learn to bridge language and cultural divides through the art of translation. TLM graduates work for private businesses, governments, and nongovernmental organizations around the world as project managers, vendor managers, account managers, localizers or translators.<!-- more -->



Professor Troyer says: _"MIIS TLM faculty and students find that Memsource is intuitive to learn for project managers and linguists, and to have such advanced features available in a cloud-based tool is simply amazing, not to mention cross-platform editors for Mac and Windows."_
