Memsource Web Editor 3.32 has been released on Thursday, 5 September 2013 at 5:30 am GMT and is now available to Memsource users. We have still retained the "beta" tag for Web Editor for the time being and expect to drop it by the end of year 2013 when it should be on par with the more mature Memsource Editor. Memsource Web Editor 3.32 includes a number of improvements and bug fixes. Let's take a look at the most important new features:<!-- more -->


### Terminology





	
  * Terms get highlighted automatically

	
    * Previously, terms would get automatically displayed for a segment only in the CAT pane

	
    * Now they get also highlighted in the source segment

  * Terms can be edited

	
    * Previously, terms could only be added from within the Web Editor

	
    * Now, terms can be edited directly by selecting the term in the CAT pane and then clicking on the source term/target term hyperlink

    * When there is a note or usage example, an asterisk (*) is displayed next to the term in the CAT pane and when the term is selected, the note and/or usage example gets displayed

	
    * Please note that in order to [display a note or usage example](http://support.memsource.com/topic/note-on-tb) in the Memsource Editor or Memsource Web Editor, it has to be entered for the source term in the term base
