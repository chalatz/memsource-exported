Yesterday I got back from Villa Nova de Gaia at the outskirts of Porto, Portugal. Josef, my collague, decided to stay one day longer and - unfortunately - was hit by the strike of air traffic controllers in Frankfurt and got stuck at the airport - how typical of him :).

The event, with about 30 attendantsÂ was generously hosted by the CEO and founder of [JABA](http://www.jaba-translations.pt/), Joaquim Alves. JABA has recently deployed machine translation technology provided by Asia Online and Joaquim summarized their early experiences, which certainly looked promising.<!-- more -->

Asia Online CEO Dion Wiggins shared his views on machine translation in the LSP context: those LSPs that deploy MT today will enjoy a competitive advantage for some time. By 2015 it will be the industry-standard to MT post-edit and it will be a competitive disadvantage NOT to use MT as a productivity booster for human translation.

I had a presentation on the Memsource approach to machine translation integration. Memsource is a proponent of tight MT integration into the CAT environment and a pioneer of the [machine translation post-editing analysis](http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Post-editing_Analysis).

Apart from being set in a beautiful location at the ocean, this gathering showed the strength of small events, when well organized and attended by a highly knowledgeable crowd.
