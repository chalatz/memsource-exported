[XTRF Management Systems](http://www.xtrf.eu/) and [MemSource](http://www.memsource.com/) have announced a roadmap leading to **deep integration** of their products today. The integration will extend the current import of Memsource analysis files in a .csv/.log format and the automatic preparation of quotes based on this data in XTRF.<!-- more -->
