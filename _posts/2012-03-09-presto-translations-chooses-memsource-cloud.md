Presto has recently subscribed to [Memsource Cloud](http://www.memsource.com/).

Katerina Benova of the Presto translation technology department said: &#8220;We have first evaluated Memsource Cloud for two months with a non-trivial translation project that involved a team of 30 translators. Our project managers as well as translators found Memsource to be intuitive and easy to use. We were also quite impressed with the ability of Memsource to process files, which our legacy translation technology could not cope with.  The fact that [Memsource Editor](http://www.memsource.com/download), the Memsource CAT tool, is available as a free download made things even easier. We were all very satisfied with the results and decided to subscribe to Memsource Cloud.&#8221;
