Memsource and [ProZ.com](http://www.proz.com/) have recently hosted a webinar that revealed some interesting facts about freelancers and technology. Although the group, with 190 registrants (and a little bit less than half that attended), cannot be viewed as representative for the freelancer community, we still got some interesting numbers. We have set up 3 polls, two of which were related to machine translation and one of which was related to cloud translation technology.<!-- more -->

And we got these results:

Sometimes freelancers are asked to use MT by their clients and so it is not their choice to use MT in this case.

Still a LOT of potential for translation cloud technology...
