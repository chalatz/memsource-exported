The comments feature has been transformed into conversations in both Memsource Editors, allowing a better interaction within the translation process. In conversation threads, the comments can be replied to by the persons involved in the translation, edited, resolved, etc., as well as filtered in editors according to who created or modified comments. Further, as compared to the previous commentsÂ propagated from lower to higher workflow steps only, the comments are now shown across all workflow steps. Users can also adjust the size of font of conversation threads.
