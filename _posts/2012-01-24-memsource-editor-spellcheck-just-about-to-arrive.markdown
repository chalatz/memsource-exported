A few of our customers have already started testing version 1.15 of Memsource Editor, which includes spellcheck. This version is not generally available yet but will be very soon. If everything goes well, it will be released to all of our users at the end of this week. For both Windows and Mac.<!-- more -->

We will publish more details, once the new version gets publicly released.
