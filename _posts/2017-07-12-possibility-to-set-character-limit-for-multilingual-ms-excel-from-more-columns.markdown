It is now possible to not only select multiple source columns inÂ [multilingual MS Excel](https://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Multilingual_XLSX) files, but you can also apply character limits from several columns.

So for example you can import columns A, B and C for translation, and apply character limits put in columns D, E and F.
