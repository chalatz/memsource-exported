We have recently started testing Memsource Editor, our new translator&#8217;s workbench. It is not out yet but it will be soon.

The Editor will be an addition to our Plugin and will also be available as a free download.<!--more-->

With Editor we will complete our goal of providing a complete **multiplatform** translation environment for Windows, Macintosh and Linux (Java is not required). Also, the Editor will make it possible to introduce some features that would not be possible in the Plugin.

And what are the first impressions? We have developed it to be really easy to use, which we think it is. And it is **fast, very fast&#8230;**
