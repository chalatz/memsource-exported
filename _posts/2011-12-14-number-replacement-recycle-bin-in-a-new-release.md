Today we have deployed a new version of Memsource Cloud. These are some of the new features:<!--more-->

### **Numbers Replacement**

Numbers get replaced automatically for fuzzy translation memory matches and if the only difference is a number(s), the score will be 99%.

### Recycle Bin

This is a feature we have had on the backend for quite a while and now we have made it available to our users. Occasionally things get deleted (translation projects, jobs, translation memories etc.). The undelete feature of the Recycle Bin will restore the deleted objects.

### Tags Ignored in Word Count

Tags get ignored in all of our counting metrics: character, word, and page count.

And a number of other minor improvements and bug fixes have been deployed.
