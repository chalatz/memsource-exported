Recently we have launched a **Reject Jobs** feature that allows users with Workflow to reject an assignment and return it to the previous step for “rework”.

This option is now available for the Ultimate edition of Memsource as well.

To allow users to Reject jobs, individual Linguist accounts need to be modified appropriately.
