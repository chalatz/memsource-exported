Memsource Web Editor 5.61 has just been released, introducing **two major improvements** that users of the desktop Memsource Editor have been able to enjoy for some time already.

You can now **click in the QA table** header to **sort entries by type**:

&nbsp;

In order to speed up the QA checking process where applicable, you can also **select multiple entries to ignore them at once**. Click on the first line, then press SHIFT and click on the last line of your selection, and then click in the &#8220;i&#8221; column to ignore all.
