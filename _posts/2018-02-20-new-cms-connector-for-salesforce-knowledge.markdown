The Salesforce Knowledge connector is the latest addition to our range of [CMS integrations](https://www.memsource.com/integrations/).  

<!-- more -->[![](/uploads/2018/02/Salesforce_logo_1000.png)](/uploads/2018/02/Salesforce_logo_1000.png)

Salesforce Knowledge is a knowledge base for users of Salesforce, a customer relationship management platform. This connector pulls articles from Salesforce Knowledge directly into Memsource and then pushes the translated content back into the Salesforce system. 

The connector is available for our Ultimate and Enterprise users.

To set up and use the Salesforce Knowledge connector in Memsource, see [our Help Center](https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003948452-Connectors#Salesforce_Knowledge_).
