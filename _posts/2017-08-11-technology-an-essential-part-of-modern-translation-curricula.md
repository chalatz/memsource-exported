<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dragos-ciobanu-50484421/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Dragoș Ciobanu</b></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">leads the </span><a href="https://www.leeds.ac.uk/arts/info/125053/centre_for_translation_studies/1803/taught_programmes_cts/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>MA program in Applied Translation Studies</b></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">(MAATS) at the </span>**University of Leeds**<span style="font-weight: 400;">. Before coming to Leeds in 2003, Dragoș worked as an in-house translator and technical writer and studied languages and translation. While working on his PhD, he contributed to several international projects that were training linguists on the latest translation technologies available and he became increasingly involved with professional organizations such as the </span><a href="http://www.iti.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ITI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://www.ciol.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CIoL</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="http://bdue.de/en/bdue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BDU</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before leaving to spend time in the e-learning field.</span>

<!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">I have always been really interested in training, technology, and language</span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>s</em>,” he explains, “</span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">so even after spending five years in the e-learning field, it felt natural to come back to the </span><a href="http://www.leeds.ac.uk/arts/info/125053/centre_for_translation_studies" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Centre for Translation Studies</b></a>_<span style="font-weight: 400;"><em> (CTS) to manage the MAATS program, establish new relationships with industry partners, and build the team who teaches its project management and computer-assisted translation technologies components</em>.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span>

## <span style="font-weight: 400;">“The initiative of CAT tool providers to provide free software for educational purposes has an immensely positive impact on the whole industry.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dragoș’s team joined the Memsource academic program in 2016 because they “</span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">felt that </span><a href="http://www.memsource.com/blog/2014/09/26/the-memsource-academic-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Memsource</b></a> **is a mature and highly capable environment,**_<span style="font-weight: 400;"><em> which our students should be familiar with</em>.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">The initiative of some, but unfortunately not all CAT tool providers, to make their software available for free for educational purposes is outstanding and has </span>**an immensely positive impact**_<span style="font-weight: 400;"><em> on the whole industry</em>,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” he added.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">Being able to experience a full localization workflow, share resources and assets, collaborate on several linguistic and project management tasks, and </span>**learn how to automate the repetitive parts of the process** <span style="font-weight: 400;">are all highly valuable skills, which I strongly believe that all linguists should be aware and fully appreciative of</span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">,” Dragoș concluded.</span>

## <span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is no longer realistic to expect translation graduates to become successful linguists without a strong understanding of the technologies.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We asked Dragoș </span>**how a present-day translation program should look** <span style="font-weight: 400;">and if he could reveal some tips for translation students on how to start and maintain a successful translation career. He provided such thorough answers, we thought it would be wise to save them and release them in their own article &#8211; stay tuned&#8230;</span>

Dragoș noted that _“it is **no longer realistic** to expect translation graduates to become successful linguists without a strong understanding of the technologies, as well as the roles of the people involved in a localization workflow_.”

<span style="font-weight: 400;">He believes that students should have ample opportunity to practice, break and fix software, and ask questions. This allows them to feel in control of the processes, understand the rationale of the technology, and then influence future optimized implementations.</span>

## <span style="font-weight: 400;">A mix of traditional “high-level” fields and vocational training</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">The translation </span>**industry is dependent on the optimal use of language technologies,** <span style="font-weight: 400;">which do change the way linguists work – starting with more or less helpful segmentation, varying degrees of context available, the propagation of sub-par previous translations, and going as far as requiring </span>**new sets of skills**_<span style="font-weight: 400;"><em> for new roles such as machine translation post-editing</em>,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” he observes.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, the CTS has adjusted its courses accordingly. They have managed to combine the traditional “high-level” fields of translation education with state-of-the-art technology training, which “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>in some eyes of the academic community</em>&#8221; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is viewed</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;<em>as not proper high-level academic training</em>,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” in addition to other elements of vocational preparation. In Leeds, they not only provide their students with </span>**theoretical knowledge** <span style="font-weight: 400;">but also </span>**with the practical experience** <span style="font-weight: 400;">that has proven to be tremendously helpful to graduates when looking for their place in a fast-paced translation market.</span>

## <span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can’t just mention the processes once and expect people to be familiar with them.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dragoș’s MAATS is a year-long, project-based program where translation theorists meet freelance professionals and technology specialists to provide a </span>**complete vocational and academic education to students**<span style="font-weight: 400;">. <em>“</em></span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">I am a big fan of the practical applied stuff because this is what students really need as soon as they leave the university</span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">,” he explains, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>but I think it’s going to be good for them if they’re motivated to think about more abstract things as well. Once they get out into the field of work, I am not sure how many opportunities they’ll have to sit back and really think hard about stuff</em>.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Being advocates for project-based learning in Leeds, they believe that “</span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">you need at least three practice student projects. By the third project, everyone is comfortable and confident. </span>**You really need to practice**_<span style="font-weight: 400;"><em> these skills; you can’t just mention the processes once and expect trainees to be familiar with them</em>.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” Dragoș added that “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>students are generally most motivated by realistic tasks</em>,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” so it is necessary to modify the courses accordingly and allow students to practice by </span>**working with NGOs**<span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

## <span style="font-weight: 400;">Programs responsive to current market demand</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside of MAATS, the CTS also offers an </span><a href="https://www.leeds.ac.uk/arts/info/125053/centre_for_translation_studies/1803/taught_programmes_cts/3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MA in Conference Interpreting and Translation Studies</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">(MACITS) and an </span><a href="https://www.leeds.ac.uk/arts/info/125053/centre_for_translation_studies/1803/taught_programmes_cts/4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MA in Audiovisual Translation Studies</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">(MAAVTS), where “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>students acquire captioning, subtitling, and live-captioning skills, and become familiar with leading subtitling and speech recognition tools</em>”. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These have become increasingly important because the British TV channels</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“<em>are falling under access requirements and have regulated captioning quotas, which led to</em></span>_ **growing demand.**_<span style="font-weight: 400;"><em> As a consequence, the major subtitling companies now rely exclusively on speech recognition tools</em>.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” Graduates learn that they can gain a substantial professional advantage if they remain </span>**responsive to the current market trends**<span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from the aforementioned activities, Dragoș is an active member of the </span><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/education/european-masters-translation-emt_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EMT network</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a project of the European Commission. In addition to implementing project-based learning activities into translation courses, Dragoș has been co-chairing a special interest group that is investigating best practices for </span>**collaborative translation training**<span style="font-weight: 400;">. He is also contributing to industry-academia initiatives such as </span><a href="http://elia-exchange.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ELIA-Exchange</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and the </span><a href="https://locworld.com/sessions/attracting-developing-talent-locworld-initiative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LocalizationWorld Attracting and Developing Talent</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">group, as well several projects. These projects include: </span><a href="http://www.digiling.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DigiLing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in which the consortium will be building freely-accessible training resources for digital linguists; </span><a href="http://orcit.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ORCIT</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which produces online multilingual and multimedia interactive training resources for conference interpreters; and lastly, Dragoș is involved in the </span><a href="https://translationcommons.org/learn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TranslationCommons</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">initiative to revive the eCoLoRe, eCoLoMedia and eCoLoTrain projects, which produces </span>**free online training resources** <span style="font-weight: 400;">for professional linguists.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">All in all, the MAATS program outlines precisely how to structure a </span>**modern translation program** <span style="font-weight: 400;">that remains responsive to real market needs. This creates highly-capable graduates who become proficient in languages, translation theory, technology, project management, and field expertise. As a result, the </span>**graduates’ employability significantly increases** <span style="font-weight: 400;">and the infamous gap between the academia and the industry continues to narrow.</span>
