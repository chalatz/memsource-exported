Memsource sponsors the event and will hold two presentations.

1) **MT and LSPs: Overcoming the Challenges** (together with Torben Dahl Jensen of the Translation House of Scandinavia, a leading Danish LSP).

This is an update on our continued effort with Torben to explore the best way of increasing human translation productivity through machine translation.

2) **Memsource Cloud: Rethinking Translation Technology**

This will be a workshop that will provide an introduction to Memsource Cloud. Everyone with a laptop computer will be able to get hands-on experience.
