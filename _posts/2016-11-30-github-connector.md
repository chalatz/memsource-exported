Users can now sync Memsource accounts with yet another online repository &#8211; GitHub. The [integration](http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Connectors) allows for manual file import only due to API limits enforced by GitHub. After a file is translated, it can be uploaded back to the online folder with a modified name.

GitHub connector, together with Google Drive and DropBox connectors, is available for all Team and Business editions.
