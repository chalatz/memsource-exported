We would like to share feedback we have recently gotten from one of our users. We decided to publish it, with the user&#8217;s kind permission, as the comment resonates with our product philosophy.<!--more-->

&#8220;Dear all,

First of all, bold and underlined: **<span style="text-decoration: underline;">THANK YOU</span>**! Memsource is a translation tool I have been dreaming of. You have done great work, it is easy to use, fast, what can I say&#8230;&#8221;
