**Demand for Translation Services from New Buyers** &#8211;** **Donald A. DePalma, Founder at [Common Sense Advisory](http://www.commonsenseadvisory.com/)

While most LSPs strive to land work from localization departments with big budgets and predictable volumes of large projects, the reality of today’s market is different. Most of the demand comes from smaller jobs, many from first-time in business or customer-facing functions like marketing, social engagement, or business intelligence. The presentation at Memsource User Meetup describes this **new category of demand**, discusses **changes in the behavior of traditional buying communities**, and recommends **how LSPs should treat the relationships that evolve with both these new and old buyers**.

**What Do Translation Buyers Expect from LSPs in 2016?** &#8211; Follow-up discussion featuring Joanna Madetko-Niedbała, Digital Project Manager | Global Marketing Communications at [Danfoss](http://www.danfoss.com)

The follow-up discussion will focus on shifts in **customer requirements on enterprise-scale projects**. Joanna Madetko-Niedbala, Global Communication Coordinator at Danfoss Group and an experienced enterprise translation buyer, will open up and lead the talk.

**Discussion points: **

  * Deep buyer involvement in the process versus an e-shop for translations: Which model will win?
  * How can LSPs create more value for enterprise customers?

This session will provide a brief overview of **Memsource technology that influences and changes translation buyer and vendor relationships**.

  * Centralized language data across the supply chain
  * Shared projects and jobs
  * Automation widget to streamline management of small jobs
  * Transparency and analytics
