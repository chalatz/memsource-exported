**UTMA **stands for **Universal Translation Memory Access**. This was the name of a research project at Charles University, Prague started in 2006 with the Globalization department of Sun Microsystems.<!-- more -->

The project ran for 3 years and resulted in the development of the UTMA server and several [IDE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) plugins.

The goal of the project was to enable software developers to leverage translation memories when writing text and error messages in source code. In short, UTMA helps developers reuse messages stored in a translation memory whenever possible rather than constantly invent new messages. In this way the messages in source code get not only more consistent but the cost for their translation can significantly decrease.
