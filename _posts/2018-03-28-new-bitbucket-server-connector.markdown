We have developed a new connector for the online repository Bitbucket Server. 

<!-- more -->

This is in addition to the recently released connector for [Bitbucket Cloud](https://www.memsource.com/blog/2018/02/27/new-bitbucket-cloud-connector/). (Learn more about the differences between [Bitbucket Cloud and Bitbucket Server](https://confluence.atlassian.com/confeval/development-tools-evaluator-resources/bitbucket/bitbucket-cloud-vs-server))

Files from Bitbucket Server can be imported into Memsource for translation and then the translated files are pushed back into Bitbucket Server from Memsource.

The connector is available for our Ultimate and Enterprise users.

To set up and use the Bitbucket Server connector in Memsource, please see [our Help Center](https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003948452-Connectors#Bitbucket_Server).
