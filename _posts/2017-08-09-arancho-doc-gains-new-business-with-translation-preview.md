They specialize in technical and marketing translations and have been using Memsource since 2017. </span>_

_<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sales Director Inge Boonen spoke with us at the 2017 GALA Conference in Amsterdam about how the <a href="http://www.memsource.com/blog/2016/11/16/introducing-in-context-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In-Context Preview feature</a> has helped speed up translation times, streamline the review process, improve quality, and even gain new translation business.</span>_

### Which clients benefit the most from the In-Context Preview feature?

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The In-Context Preview feature in Memsource is very helpful because it provides a preview of content in complex file formats, such as InDesign files. We primarily target marketing managers with this feature because they typically like the translated materials, such as a brochure or a flyer, to be approved by local markets before being printed. Before this feature, it wasn’t easy for reviewers to check the translation quality of brochures or flyers within the final layout, and so we had to find workaround solutions to this problem by creating additional steps in the workflow process.</span>

### What was your translation process with an InDesign file before using the preview?

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Previously, we received an InDesign file from the client and extracted the text so it would be translation-ready. Once the translation was completed, we would send a Word file with a bilingual table to the client asking for it to be reviewed and approved. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The result of this was that the local reviewers were not able to see the translations in context. They would blindly review the text and would only be able to see the PDF with the translation after we had re-imported the text into the desktop publisher. Then, quite often, after seeing the translation within the final layout, they would want to make some additional changes.</span>

### How has this feature allowed you to expand your business?

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We were working with the marketing department of a large pharmaceutical company, and we noticed that the review process was rather cumbersome and inefficient. Thanks to Memsource’s In-Context Preview, we were able to offer them a PDF review instead of the bilingual table in Word.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The marketing manager was very happy with this solution &#8211; she felt that timelines were reduced and that quality control was improved. As a result, she spoke with the training department at her company and advised them to come to us for their translation needs too. That was a very nice result for us.</span>
