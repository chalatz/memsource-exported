Memsource is enabling Project Archive for projects that do not need to be visible in the list of Projects anymore.

You can simply go to the list of projects, choose from the list visible (or filter for specific) projects and use the **Archive** button to move projects to the Archive, which is accessible under **Setup**. Projects moved here will disappear from the list of active projects and will become unaccessible until they are restored from the Archive.

Project Archive is currently available only for BIZ Ultimate edition.
