Multimedia localization company hakromedia has developed a connector from their subtitle editing workbench subCloud to Memsource.  It is now possible to **connect to Memsource projects while translating subtitles**, and benefit from translation memory, term bases and machine translation.

subCloud is provided to hakromedia customers as a Cloud-based SaaS on a per-minute and per-language basis. It is available after authorization with the company.<!-- more -->

![subcloudlogo](/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/subcloudlogo.jpg)hakromedia subCloud is an online editing module that allows users to create and edit subtitles in the browser. The subtitles are displayed in real-time against the streaming video. subCloud introduces a professional translation
process into subtitle localization, including workflows, job assignment and automation.

The integration to Memsource now adds a live connection to existing translation memories and term bases to speed up the subtitle translation and ensure terminology consistency.

hakromedia subCloud is a Browser based solution. There are no additional system requirements.
