<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Memsource Translation Plugin for WordPress works together with the Memsource WordPress Connector to automatically import posts, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">pages, tags and categories into Memsource for translation and then push the translated content back into WordPress. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest version (v2.1.1) includes an important new feature &#8211; a language mapping page. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This page gives users the option to map default WPML language codes to Memsource language codes as the codes used within the Memsource platform can be different.</span>

  <em>Memsource WordPress Plugin Language Mapping page</em>
</h6>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is often the case with specific language locales. For example, WPML only uses “fr” for French but the source or target language of the content may need to have a specific locale, like French Canadian. In Memsource, the code for this is “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fr_ca”.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The language codes on the mapping page and those in Memsource need to match for the Memsource WordPress Connector to work properly. See our list of all the </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">supported languages</span>](https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003929811-Supported-Languages%5C) <span style="font-weight: 400;">in Memsource. </span>
