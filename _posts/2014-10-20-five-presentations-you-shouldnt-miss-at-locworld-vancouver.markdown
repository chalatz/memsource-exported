With less than two weeks to go and with over 400 people signed up, upcoming Localization World is a major trade show on everyone's radars. It offers some of the best content on software localization, but at certain points the program runs in 6 concurrent tracks. So unless you have an army of clones (co-workers?) at your disposal, you're going to see only 10 out of 47 main day sessions.  Time is money: travel plus entrance fees translates into $125 or more per presentation. So, where to go for max value?<!-- more -->

Our recommendation is to prioritize content that cannot be accessed at other events, webinars or training programs. Presentations by enterprise translation buyers by far fall under this category. Even if other sessions are more relevant to you, it might make more sense to research them online, and spend time on unique content at the venue.

We've prepared a selection of 5 presentations we consider a promising choice, even if not the most obvious at first glance. This list does not include keynotes, because no other presentations will take place at the same time. Attending keynotes doesn't mean skipping anything else.



	
  * **Can You Have Your Cake and Eat It? Agile Localization with Quality**




Speakers: Elise Lee (Microsoft), Andrew Vestal (Microsoft)

This presentation impresses by the sheer size of the project: 105 languages in rapid localization. Which practices and tools does the team use to stay agile with a behemoth of task in front of them?






	
  * **Terminology Management Strategy: Managing Your Enterprise-level Terminology Databases**




Caroline Koff (Hewlett-Packard)




![](https://www.memsource.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Koff.jpg)





Centralizing terminology and cleaning termbases can be tedious, but with hundreds of internal organizations at HP producing independent termdatabases it turns into a Herculean labor. Do traditional methods of managing terminology still apply at such scale, or does the localization team have to invent something entirely new?






	
  * **Going Global at High Speed: How Modern Brands Are Leapfrogging the Localization Learning Curve**




Matt Koidin (Pocket), Bryan Lopuck (Hotel Tonight), Silvia Oviedo-Lopez (Pinterest)




![](https://www.memsource.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Koidin.jpg)![](https://www.memsource.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Lopuck.jpg)![](https://www.memsource.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/OviedoLopez.jpg)




Given a clean slate and a big task, how would you start? With a myriad of options at their disposal from professional translation and PEMP to crowdsourcing, what do modern brands choose to get global?






	
  * **Closing the Translation Gap — Building a Business-driven Globalization Strategy for Content**




Alan Porter (Caterpillar Inc.)




![](https://www.memsource.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PorterA.jpg)




Again, the sheer size of the project is amazing. Customer support for 180 countries, marketing materials and technical documentation require a lot of strategic thinking. It will be interesting to tap into the decision-making process behind globalization on a grand scale and see how value of practices and tools is calculated in a long-term perspective.






	
  * **The Evolution of Globalization at PayPal**




Salvo Giammarresi (PayPal)




![](https://www.memsource.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Giammarresi.jpg)




Some of the steps Paypal took to establish an efficient process of globalization have been covered in case studies by Safaba and PROMT machine translation companies. It will be interesting to hear from the client what these projects accomplished, and what conclusions can be drawn from them.
