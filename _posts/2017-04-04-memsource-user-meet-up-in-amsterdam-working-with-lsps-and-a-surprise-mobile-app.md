Around 70 Memsource users and friends attended the 6th Memsource User Meet-Up on Sunday, March 26, 2017 at Hotel Okura in Amsterdam prior to the start of the annual GALA conference.<!--more-->

The user meet-up opened with a presentation by Memsource CEO David Canek, who introduced some recently launched features such as <a href="http://www.memsource.com/blog/2017/02/27/new-homepage-analytics-dashboards-to-track-localization/" target="_blank">analytics</a> and <a href="http://www.memsource.com/blog/2017/03/16/client-portals-a-new-customer-focused-solution/" target="_blank">client portals</a>, and offered a sneak-peak of some upcoming features (but our blog visitors will have to wait for that!). David also gave a <a href="http://www.memsource.com/blog/2017/01/31/memsource-in-2016-and-my-new-years-resolution/" target="_blank">review of Memsource in 2016</a>, reporting the numbers of words translated, the increased useage of APIs and connectors, and company growth.

Software Developer, Vojtech Novak, then presented a demonstration of the surprise new feature &#8211; the <a href="http://www.memsource.com/blog/2017/03/27/announcing-the-memsource-mobile-app/" target="_blank">Memsource mobile app</a>, available for project managers and translators on Google Play and the App Store.

The main event was a panel discussion entitled “To Work With an LSP or not to Work With an LSP? That is the question” featuring Alan Broad from Shell International; Eveline van Sandick owner of Attached; Malon Hamoen, CEO of Euro-Comm International; and Robert Etches, CIO of TextMinded. Panelists and audience members discussed the pros and cons as well as the challenges and advantages of working with LSPs and the difference of in-house vs. external translation teams.
