A new version of Memsource Cloud has arrived with lots of new features:<!--more-->

### Drag & drop language columns in term base

When editing a term base with multiple languages, it is useful to organize the order of the languages as one needs to. The new drag & drop feature does exactly that.
  
<span style="font-weight: normal;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/drag-and-drop-term-base1.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-203" title="drag-and-drop-term-base" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/drag-and-drop-term-base1-300x207.png" alt="" width="300" height="207" /></a></span>

### Create a Customer Portal with Guest User Access

Guest User Access makes it really easy to share specific translation memories, term bases or projects with a guest user, which could be a client of a translation agency for example. An actual customer portal can be set up virtually in minutes, making it possible for the customer/guest user to browse or search the enabled data. And its integration into a corporate website is actually very easy.

### Use a Custom Logo for Memsource Cloud

Another way of customizing Memsource is to upload your organization&#8217;s logo!
