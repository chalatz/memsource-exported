Autumn event season has begun. Today our business development manager Josef Kubovsky has crossed the Atlantic for Memsource’s first live visit to Canada. There we are an exhibitor at [AILIA Language Industry Showcase 2014](http://www.ailia.ca/Events), the annual conference of Canadian language industry association. This bilingual French and English event, titled Foire 2014 in French, brings together top Canadian translation companies, procurers, research and standardization professionals.<!--more-->

Josef Kubovsky will deliver two presentations at the Showcase. On the 18th of September he will give a traditional overview of Memsource and its new features, including shared projects, [instant quotes](/memsource-cloud-4-4-release/) and the out-of-Beta [web editor](/memsource-web-editor-4-44-released/). On the 19th of September comes fresh content, titled:

**How can LSPs win new business through technology?**

This new presentation revolves around growth opportunities that are created when translation companies go tech-savvy and evangelize their software solutions to clients. Here are some tidbits from the presentation.

  * Package translation services and technology together to offer more to prospects;
  * Use API to integrate with customers’ CMS, and stay ahead of competitors that don’t have that level of partnership;
  * Provide platform for client’s in-house reviewers, and get a pulse of what’s happening upstream on the supply chain;
  * Consult and guide your enterprise clients to become their preferred strategic partner in localization and internationalization.

If you are attending #ailia2014, don’t miss this session on Friday, 11.00 am, track B.
