Prague/Berlin, 23 May 2012

Plunet and Memsource have announced partnership today that marks the beginning of an integration process between [Plunet BusinessManager](http://www.plunet.com/de/businessmanager/) and Memsource Cloud as well as Memsource Server. To start with, Plunet customers can import Memsource word count analysis into BusinessManager as of today. Additional integration is planned to further streamline workflow for customers who use both Plunet BusinessManager and Memsource Cloud or Memsource Server.<!--more-->

Memsource provides a powerful cloud-based translation environment that includes translation memory, integrated machine translation, terminology management and a free translator&#8217;s workbench.

_&#8220;When I first saw Memsource Cloud, I was quite impressed,&#8221;_ said Stefan Dümig, co-founder and Managing Director of Plunet. &#8220;_The user interface is very intuitive and easy to use but still delivers the functionality that&#8217;s expected from a translation memory system. Over the past year I have seen Memsource gain traction among the web-based CAT tools and I am excited that we can announce our partnership today.&#8221;_

David Canek, CEO of Memsource commented: _&#8220;M__any of our customers are also happy users of Plunet BusinessManager.
