### PROJECT MANAGEMENT

  * **Introducing the instant quote widget** 
      * The instant quote widget makes it extremely easy for anyone to submit new translation jobs into Memsource and receive instant word count and even a quote. All a person needs to do is click on a link (from a website or intranet &#8211; try it yourself) and upload the files for translation. **No Memsource login information is needed**. Once translated, the person is notified by email and can download the translated files and so the instant quote feature can serve as a mini translation portal:

  * Translation agencies can provide instant quote widgets to their customers and so receive more jobs for translation from them &#8211; because the instant quote widget is so easy and convenient to use.
  * Translation buyers can distribute instant quote widgets to any number of their business units and streamline the internal translation process.

  * The instant quote widget is  essentially a URL that can be generated by a Memsource administrator or project manager under Setup &#8211; Instant Quotes. an instant quote widget can be associated with a project template in order to apply specific project settings, use a specific price list, translation memories for the analysis, term bases for terminology, etc.

  * A Memsource organization can create any number of instant quote widgets. For instance, a translation company could create an instant quote widget: 
      * For each of their major customers
      * For their website
  * The instant quote feature is available to subscribers of all Memsource editions except Personal and 1+ Freelancers.

  * **Introducing quotes** 
      * This feature is currently only available to the subscribers of the new [business editions](http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/MemSource_Editions#Editions_for_Translation_Buyers) that have been designed for translation buyers.
      * A new section &#8220;Quotes&#8221; is displayed in projects.
      * A quote can be created based on an existing analysis in a project; a price list and a net rate scheme can be applied.
      * A quote can have the following statuses: 
          * New
          * Approved
          * Declined
      * Quotes can be useful for shared projects, e.g. a translation buyer can ask a vendor (translation company) to provide a quote that can be later approved by the buyer.
      * Quotes are available to subscribers with one of the business editions (BIZ Start, BIZ Team or BIZ Ultimate)
