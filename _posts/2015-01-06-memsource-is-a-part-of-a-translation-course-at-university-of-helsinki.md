[<img class="alignleft" title="University of Helsinki" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/summerschool-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" />](http://www.helsinki.fi/annualreport2013/glance.html)The University of Helsinki students will practice translating and managing projects with Memsource under a new translation training course developed by Anu Carnegie-Brown of Sandberg Translation Partners Ltd and a group of industry peers.<!--more-->

Starting on the 5th of January and lasting until May 2015, the course includes three weeks of classroom-based learning as well as independent self-study exercises. The topics cover the global translation market, job opportunities in the translation industry, language technology including CAT and QA tools, translation management systems and machine translation solutions, a project management workshop and two books written by industry practitioners.

While preparing the students for the workplace and managing their expectations, the project sets out to create best practices for the global translation industry and demonstrate that commercially viable win-win partnerships can be established through voluntary knowledge sharing.

Professionals from Finnish translation companies AAC Global, AranchoDoc Nordic, Delingua, Lingsoft, Maris Multilingual and Semantix, as well as technology experts from Memsource, Kilgray, Plunet and SDL have been allocated a portion of the course content to cover. All of the companies are offering their contributions free of charge. The course will run as an independent regional project with affiliations to both GALA association’s Global Talent programme and ELIA’s Exchange initiative.
