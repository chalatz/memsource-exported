Memsource is launching a certification program for trainers. Experienced users will be able to provide paid training and consulting services to other Memsource users.<!--more-->Â  Trainers will receive a digital certificate and a listing on memsource.com, and we will refer them to nearby customers that wish to receive live training, or to get online training in their native language.

&nbsp;

## Become a certified trainer

To join the program, please write to [Vaclav Balacek](mailto:vb@memsource.com) at vb@memsource.com. You will need to:

  1. Attend a training course providing detailed insight into Memsource.
  2. Learn Memsource deep enough to be able to train other users.
  3. Demonstrate your competences at a 60-minute one-to-one online session with a member of our support/training department.

Once you pass your exam, you will be eligible to become a Memsource Certified Trainer. We will list your name and profile on Memsource.com, send you a digital certificate and promote your services among existing and potential Memsource users. Translation companies can certify their staff to improve value proposition to buyers.
