MLVs, SLVs and end clients can work in a single, connected environment in Memsource Cloud. Real-time TM updates, terminology and job progress are shared across the entire team, while other information, including names of translators, is kept strictly private. This approach provides a very powerful feature set for MLVs and SLVs looking to streamline their translation process. Elia members can benefit from an extended [60-day free trial and 1-hour online training](http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Memsource_Cloud_User_Manual#Shared_Projects_Introduction) in Shared Jobs and Instant Quotes features. To use this offer, contact Josef at <jk@memsource.com>.

  * If you are an MLV, take a look at how Moravia, Semantix and Honyaku Center use Memsource to empower workflow with SLVs and freelancers.
  * If you are an SLV, sign-up for your own Memsource Cloud account, MLVs will be more likely to give you translation work if you can connect to their systems.
