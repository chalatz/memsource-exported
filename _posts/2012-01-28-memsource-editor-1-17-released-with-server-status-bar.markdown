A new release of Memsource Editor is out: 1.17

As always, this version brings a number of small improvements and bug fixes. There is, however, one feature that stands out: We have introduced a much needed server status bar, which provides real-time information on the user's connection status to Memsource Cloud servers. The status bar can be:<!-- more -->



	
  * green = connected

	
  * red = not connected

	
  * gray = connected but no translation memory or term base assigned to the bilingual file that's open in the Editor




What gets monitored:








	
  * Login (whether the user logged in successfully from the Editor)

	
  * TM (translation memory server connection status)

	
  * TB (term base server connection status)

	
  * MT (machine translation server connection status)




Memsource Editor will get[ upgraded automatically](http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/MemSource_Editor_User_Manual#MemSource_Editor_Upgrades) to existing users, new users can [download it from here](http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/MemSource_Editor_Installation).
