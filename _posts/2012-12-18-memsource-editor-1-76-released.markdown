We have released Memsource Editor 1.76 today with a couple of improvements:<!-- more -->



	
  * Encrypted communication

	
    * Encrypted communication between Memsource Cloud servers and Memsource Editor is now supported. To enable it, add the **https** prefix to the Server url under File - Preferences - Login:

  * Repetition exception

	
    * An exception to the repetition chain can be introduced by clicking on the repetition icon and marking one or more of the repetitions as a repetition exception:

  * File name displayed

	
    * The file name gets now displayed in Memsource Editor's status bar. This is exceptionally useful for [joined files](http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Join_Files)Â but also for all other files:

  * Not Allowed - a new QA check

	
    * This new QA check has been introduced in [Memsource Cloud 2.8](/better-usability-and-full-encryption-memsource-cloud-2-8/) and this is what the what it looks like in Memsource Editor when the warning gets displayed:
