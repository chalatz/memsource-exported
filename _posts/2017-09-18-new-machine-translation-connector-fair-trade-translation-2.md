Memsource now offers a connector to Fair Trade Translation.

[Fair Trade Translation](https://www.fairtradetranslation.com/) provides a combination of machine translation and machine translation quality evaluation, aiming at improving the possibility of MT leveraging for better, faster and more cost effective translation.

This is stage one of the implementation, which includes merely an exchange of data for machine translation by FTT. More features and enhancements should follow.
