Users are now able to set up a fully automated process through which:



 	
  * Memsource will establish a connection with an online repository (Google Drive, Dropbox or FTP)

 	
  * Memsource will check selected folders for new content, at defined time intervals

 	
  * All newly detected files will be sent to an automatically created Memsource project

 	
  * After the translations are finished, the files are sent back to the location from which they were retrieved


You will find more details [in our documentation](http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Automated_Project_Creation).
