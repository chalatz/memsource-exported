Headquartered in Prague, Czech Republic, Skrivanek is among the top 50 language service providers in the world and was a top-grossing company in 2016 for outsourced language translations and interpreting services, as recognized by Common Sense Advisory. It provides a variety of professional language services to major multinational corporations and government entities including the United Nations, the European Union, European Investment Bank, and World Bank.

In selecting Memsource, Skrivanek cited the speed and flexibility of the platform that can be easily customized to provide quality and accurate translations for their global business needs. It valued the ability to work both online and offline, the options to share, manage, and edit multiple translation memories in real-time, and the ability to split and merge segments. It also highlighted the Support team’s “lightning fast” assistance.

“Skrivanek prides itself on the ability to manage large, complex translation projects for our clients with specific attention to quality and specialized terminology,” said Jaroslava Ouzka, Global Sales Manager. “Memsource provides a flexible and customizable technology platform with advanced features that will enable us to continue to provide fast, high-quality translations.”
