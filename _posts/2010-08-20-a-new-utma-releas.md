  <p>
    We have just released a new version of the UTMA server and plugins. The main new features are listed below.<!--more-->
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>The Server</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>A new reporting module. </em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em></em>1. Plugin usage statistics get captured, detailing the number of:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      views of the Replace/Confirm Dialog Box
    </li>
    <li>
      strings that got replaced
    </li>
    <li>
      strings that got confirmed
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    2. String matches from the internal repository within the UTMA server get displayed along with matches from the translation memory
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Plugins</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    1. New strings with a 100% match against a confirmed string do not get highlighted anymore
  </p>
  
  <p>
    2. New strings are split  into two groups:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    a) those with no match are highlighted in green so that the developer can confirm them right away;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    b) those with a match are highlighted in yellow, encouraging the developer to  check the available alternatives
  </p>
  
  <p>
    3. Update centers have been introduced for comfortable plugin updating.
