We’re excited to announce the launch of our new user <a href="https://help.memsource.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Help Center</a>!

Starting on Tuesday, January 23, Memsource’s user documentation (formerly wiki.memsource.com) and community support center have been merged into one centralized platform powered by <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zendesk</a>.<!--more-->

&nbsp;

## New Help Center Highlights

  * **Centralized Content** &#8211; The user manuals have been restructured to include both documentation content and relevant help articles.
  * **Community Center** &#8211; A new community center provides space for posting questions and having discussions with other users and Memsource Support professionals. Anyone can view posts and articles, but users must have a Memsource Help Center account and be <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/signin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">logged into the new Help Center</a> to create or comment on a post. (Your Memsource Help Center account is different from your Memsource Cloud account.)
  
    Note: If you had an account in our previous Support Center, when you log in to our new Help Center for the first time **you will need to create a new password**.
  * **Ticketing System** &#8211; A new ticketing system is available for users who wish to contact the Memsource Support team. To access the system, users can click “<a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/requests/new" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Submit a request</a>” to fill out a form for the Support team. The option to [contact Support via email](mailto:support@memsource.com) will continue to be an option, but the ticketing system allows users to be able to track the progress of requests and bug reports.
  * **Improved Search** &#8211; The improved searching functionality scans all related articles and community center posts to provide relevant information on topics.
  * **Additional Content** &#8211; New content has been added to help enhance user experience in the Help Center, including “Tips and Tricks” within the <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/sections/115000969251-Tips-and-Tricks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Memsource Cloud</a> and <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/sections/115000903851-Tips-and-Tricks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Memsource Desktop and Web Editors</a> documentation and an <a href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/sections/115000869791-FAQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FAQ section</a> has been added to the “Getting Started” category.

&nbsp;

Additional content migrations from the wiki documentation site will be finalized over the coming weeks, but all new updates to content will be in the new platform, excluding the dynamic <a href="https://cloud.memsource.com/web/docs/api" target="_blank" rel="noopener">REST API documentation</a>. All content from the legacy Support Center has been migrated.
