**Years of experience in the translation industry:** 8,5.

**Years of experience as Memsource user:** 6 months.<!--more-->

**Why did you choose to become Memsource Certified Trainer?** Because, after 8 and a half years in the translation industry, I believe that Memsource is a great tool and I really enjoy it. Apart from that, I was also responsible to move the company <a href="http://en.purefluent.com/" target="_blank">PureFluent</a> from SDL Trados Studio to Memsource.

**In which language(s) will you give Memsource training? **English and Polish.

**What activities are you developing &#8211; or have developed &#8211; as Memsource trainer? **I am currently extending the audience/customers who are interested in buying CAT tools and trying to show them how CAT tools can help them in their work and cut the costs in their business.

**What kind of audience do you plan to train/are you training?** Translation agencies, translators and proofreaders, translation departments of various companies.

**Which are the most useful Memsource functionalities for your work?** Filters customization (especially <a href="http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/XML" target="_blank">XML filter</a> and <a href="http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/MS_Excel" target="_blank">Excel filters</a>), <a href="http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Automation_Widget" target="_blank">automation widgets</a>, automation of translators&#8217; assignment.

**What do you like most about Memsource?** That it is web-based and a very clear, customizable, <a href="http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Memsource_API" target="_blank">API-enabled environment</a>.

**Anything else you would like to share?** I have been passionate about Memsource since the first time I learnt about this platform. At that time, I was working as CAT tools engineer for a British translation agency and my daily work relied on SDL Trados Studio, which was an increasingly difficult experience. I have moved the whole company to Memsource and immediately started to see a positive difference. Now I am trying to investigate Memsource even more to answer the increasing number of requests related to Memsource Cloud.
