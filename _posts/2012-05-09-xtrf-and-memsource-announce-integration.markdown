[XTRF Management Systems](http://www.xtrf.eu/) and [Memsource Technologies](http://www.memsource.com/) have announced integration of their flagship translation products today. The integration provides for an easy import of Memsource analysis files in a .csv/.log format and the automatic preparation of quotes based on this data in XTRF.<!-- more -->

XTRF Managing Director Andrzej Nedoma comments on the integration: "XTRF is a leading translation management system and we feel it is important to integrate with other leading products in the translation ecosystem. We have seen Memsource Cloud grow and gain in importance since its launch in early 2011, and therefore are glad that we can announce our integration today."

Memsource Technologies CEO David Canek adds: "A number of our customers also use XTRF to manage their translation projects, therefore we thought it was only logical to integrate with XTRF's leading translation management software. With today's analysis file integration we are making the first step, deeper integration will follow."
