**Memsource has launched a new community and e-mail Support Center.** The existing [Memsource Community Support](http://support.memsource.com/) forum will continue to exist and be used as a knowledge base, but all new traffic will be redirected to the new Support Center.

<!-- more -->

Compared to the previous platform, the new Support Center - which includes now all relevant articles and data - will provide **additional** **benefits**.

-          Users can choose whether to **post a public question** - perhaps when seeking some best-practice advice - or **send a private e-mail** to the Memsource support desk.

-          All new posts and articles will be classified under** five** **categories**:


o   **General:** Information and answers to general questions (e.g. how you can pay for Memsource).




o   **Tutorials:** Getting started guides for project managers and linguist users, and other user documentation.




o   **Memsource Cloud:** Articles dealing with issues related to the Memsource Cloud platform.




o   **Memsource Editor: **Articles on issues related to Memsource Editor, both the desktop and web-based versions.




o   **Memsource API**: Tips and tricks as well as troubleshooting information.


-          Before users post a question, the system will suggest solutions.

An example: If you want to ask how to upgrade to another edition of Memsource Cloud...

-          The new support forum also provides **statistics and analytics. **This will allow the Support Team to better understand what kind of information Memsource users look for and improve it.

The new Support Center will give users a better experience, as all instructions, guidance and best practices will be within an even easier reach.
