A new version of Memsource Editor, which has just been released, provides users with better insight into the translation progress in the file they are working on.

We have added a simple indicator in the status bar, showing the total number of **segments, words and characters**, followed by a slash and in green the total number of** confirmed segments, words and characters.** All is based on counting the source. See the status bar at the screenshot below.<!--more-->
