We have recently released Memsource Editor 1.56. This new version introduces additional filtering options, specifically segment filtering by segment status. A previous version (1.49) has introduced [segment filtering by text content](/segment-filtering-as-you-type-memsource-editor-1-49/).<!-- more -->

Version 1.56 introduces segment filtering by segment status.


### A user can filter segments that are:





	
  * Empty

	
  * 1st repetition

	
  * With a comment

	
  * Confirmed

	
  * Not confirmed

	
  * With resolved comments

	
  * With not resolved comments




### Or based on their pre-translate status:





	
  * 101%

	
  * 100%

	
  * Fuzzy

	
  * MT

	
  * Non-translatables
