We received a lot of questions during our webinar that kicked off the [MT Post-editing Experiment](http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/The_MT_Post-editing_Experiment). We were not able to answer all of them, so we are providing the answers below:<!--more-->

&nbsp;

**Q: Where is the link for setting up the MT post-editing starter kit?**

A: [Here](http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/The_MT_Post-editing_Experiment#The_Starter_Kit).

&nbsp;

**Q: Does the post-editing effort calculation consider sentence length while making the calculations per word? A single word corrected in a two-word sentence vs a 10-word sentence?**

A:  Yes, it does.

&nbsp;

**Q: What happens if a client wants a quote before we proceed with the translation?**

A: It is true that the post-editing analysis can only be launched after the translation is made. It is clear that you will in most cases need to produce a quote before you start translating. You should first run a standard (we call it a default analysis in MemSource) analysis that will analyze the source to produce a quote. Based on your experience you could adjust the quote by an additional estimated brought about by machine translation post-editing. To be on the safe side, you could leave the quote as it is and if you make any additional saving during the translation process, this will increase your margin.

&nbsp;

**Q: Is there any possibility how to deploy Trados in your workflow?**

A: Not really. Memsource is a replacement for Trados, not an addition.

&nbsp;

**Q: As to the experiment: Are there any rules for PE? Understandability &#8211; grammar &#8211; style? Highest possible target text quality?**

A: We would not be able to objectively measure these. The objectives of the experiment are [listed here](http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/The_MT_Post-editing_Experiment#The_Experiment.27s_Objective).

&nbsp;

**Q: Could you please confirm if it&#8217;s possible to use just the analysis feature in Memsource without the rest of the system?**

A: This is not possible as the analysis draws data from a number of Memsource components, e.g. Memsource XLIFF file, Memsource Editor, Memsource Cloud&#8230;

&nbsp;

**Q: Any chance we can use another MT solution than Bing or Google? Asia Online?**

A: Yes, any MT engine with a decent API can be set up to work in Memsource Cloud. Contact [Memsource support](http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/MemSource_Support).

&nbsp;

**Q: Do we have to buy the Google API or any other API to use machine translation?**

A: Yes, you have to [get your own API key](http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Machine_Translation), Microsoft has a free trial period.

&nbsp;

**Q: What are the privacy settings for the PE environment?**

A: Any data that you upload to Memsource Cloud remain [private, confidential, and secure](http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/MemSource_Cloud_-_Terms_of_Service#User_Content).

&nbsp;

**Q: What exactly are these &#8220;MT match ranges&#8221;?**

A: These are e.g. 95% to 99% or 85% to 94% as can be seen in a [post-editing analysis](http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Post-editing_Analysis).

&nbsp;

**Q: Will it be possible to get a recording of this Memsource demo?**

A: Yes, it has been posted on [our YouTube channel](http://youtu.be/k6kK67dNFVE).

&nbsp;

**Q: This is really cool; however, I am concerned about sending customer segments off to Microsoft Translator or Google &#8211; they both have license agreements that give them rights to the content submitted &#8220;in perpetuity&#8221; &#8211; your customer might not be happy about that&#8230;**

A: If you have concerns, I suggest you use another machine translation service. Any MT technology with a decent API can be easily connected to Memsource Cloud.

&nbsp;

**Q: Could it be possible to create an option that would allow us to choose whether to have tags displayed in MT output or not?**

A: Yes, this would be possible.

&nbsp;

**Q: Can Memsource integrate Systran Desktop 7 premium?**

A: We can integrate Systran server products, not desktop.

&nbsp;

**Q: What would be the process to connect to a &#8220;secure&#8221; MT engine (rather than MS translator or Google Translate)?**

A: To connect another MT engine, even a custom one, is possible. Please contact [Memsource support](http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/MemSource_Support) for details.

&nbsp;

**Q: After the trial period, what would be the terms of use? Pricing?**

A: [These](http://www.memsource.com/pricing/) or better &#8211; please contact sales@memsource.com for details.
