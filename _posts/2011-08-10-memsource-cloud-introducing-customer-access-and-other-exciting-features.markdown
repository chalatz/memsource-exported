A new version of Memsource Cloud has arrived with lots of new features:<!-- more -->


### Drag & drop language columns in term base


When editing a term base with multiple languages, it is useful to organize the order of the languages as one needs to. The new drag & drop feature does exactly that.

### Create a Customer Portal with Guest User Access


Guest User Access makes it really easy to share specific translation memories, term bases or projects with a guest user, which could be a client of a translation agency for example. An actual customer portal can be set up virtually in minutes, making it possible for the customer/guest user to browse or search the enabled data. And its integration into a corporate website is actually very easy.

### Use a Custom Logo for Memsource Cloud


Another way of customizing Memsource is to upload your organization's logo!
