It is very rewarding when customers are happy with our work, such as this Project Manager of a not so small translation agency:<!--more-->

## _Also I wanted to say thank you for such rapid updates and response times. YouÂ guys are doing a great job really&#8230;_

Memsource customers are mainly translation agencies as well as translation/localization departments at organizations all over the world: North and South America, Western and Eastern Europe, Asia&#8230;
