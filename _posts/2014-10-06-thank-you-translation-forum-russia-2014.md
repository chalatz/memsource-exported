Translation Forum Russia 2014 in Yekaterinburg was a very dynamic and productive event for Memsource. The participants were passionate about technology, responsive and eager for knowledge. It was great to see huge interest to cloud translation tools and Memsource in particular. We&#8217;d like to say a heartfelt and sincere &#8220;Thanks!&#8221; to the organizers and attendees for making such an energetic event. We hope to see you again next time.<!--more-->

This year we were an exhibitor and a sponsor at the conference. Our user Ilya Mishchenko, Director of Translation and Localisation Centre of EGO Translating, delivered a presentation based on two years experience running huge projects with millions words via Memsource. Thanks, Ilya, that was impressive.

And Josef Kubovsky, business development manager for Memsource, was a panelist at a discussion connecting CAT Tools vendors and their Russian users. Together with SDL&#8217;s Paul Filkin and ABBYY&#8217;s Anton Voronov they&#8217;ve collected feedback from the professional community to take this info to the developers.

At the wrap-up session of the conference we ran a prize draw that won by Andrey Pshenichnov from Infotecs Internet Security Software. Congratulations!

With approximately 300 participants, Translation Forum Russia is one of the most significant national translation conferences in the world. We&#8217;ve attended 3 TFRs so far, and they are always lively and vigorous if a bit carefree and free-spirited. They bring together a mix of people from all sides of the market: freelancers, translation company owners, corporate documentation departments and buyers, professors and students, association heads and government officials. This way, all opinions are accounted and there is greater diversity in topics.

We&#8217;re grateful to the event organizer Elena Kislova for making it all possible. Thanks and till next year!
