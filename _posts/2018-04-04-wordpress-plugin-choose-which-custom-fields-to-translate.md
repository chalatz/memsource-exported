<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have added a new page to the Memsource Translation Plugin for WordPress which allows users to select custom fields to translate. Custom fields, also known as post metadata, include extra information about a specific post or page. Learn more about </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">custom fields in WordPress</span>](https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Custom_Fields)<span style="font-weight: 400;">.<br /> </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Previously, when translating a WordPress post or page in Memsource, all the content in the custom fields would also be exported from WordPress into Memsource and translated. This new option means that Memsource users can select which custom fields are and are not translated. This is particularly important as some WordPress themes automatically create customs fields that include non-translatable content.<br /> </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To use this feature, you will need to download the latest version of the Memsource Translation Plugin for WordPress. You should be notified by WordPress about this update. You can also download the latest version of the plugin from the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/memsource-connector/">Memsource page</a> on theÂ WordPress Marketplace.<br /> </span>
