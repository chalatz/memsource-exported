You asked, we listened! After speaking to some users of our WordPress and Drupal plugins, we’ve released some important updates to provide more options for users wanting to connect their CMS platform to Memsource Cloud for seamless translation.


### WordPress Plugin - Support for Page Builders and Additional Localization


The [Memsource Translation Plugin for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/memsource-connector/) works together with the Memsource WordPress Connector to automatically pull content from pages and posts for translation. The latest version (v 2.0) has been updated with a number of features, including:



 	
  * Translation support for tags and categories

 	
  * Support for popular page builders - Avada, Divi, and WPBakery (formerly Visual Composer)

 	
  * Custom shortcode insertion - After building a custom shortcode in a third party plugin, easily add it to your WordPress site with our shortcode editor to translate your shortcode content


Learn more about the Memsource Translation Plugin for WordPress in the [Memsource documentation](https://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/WordPress_Plugin).


### Drupal Plugin - Now on TMGMT


Memsource’s original Drupal plugin was for version 8. The additional plugin on [Drupal’s marketplace](https://www.drupal.org/project/tmgmt_memsource) allows users with Drupal 7 and Drupal 8 to connect to Memsource and easily translate all Drupal text elements supported by the TMGMT module.
