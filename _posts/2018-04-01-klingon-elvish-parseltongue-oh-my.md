In the true spirit of Memsource, we strive to go where no translation platform has gone before. This includes our language selection.*<!--more-->

_*Disclaimer: We’re not 100% sure no one else has these new languages, but it sounded catchy._

Our list of 400+ supported languages is always growing. Our most recent (and undoubtedly most nerdy) additions include favorites from some of the biggest fantasy book and film franchises.

These languages include:

  * Klingon &#8211; Star Trek
  * Parseltongue &#8211; Harry Potter
  * Dothraki &#8211; Game of Thrones
  * Elvish &#8211; Lord of the Rings
  * Wookiee &#8211; Star Wars

_**April Fools!**_ We&#8217;re just kidding. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sort of.</span>

It’s true, we’re not adding MOST of these, but Klingon will actually be available in our supported languages on Tuesday, April 3. **That’s no joke.**

Qapla’! (Success!) Happy Translating!
