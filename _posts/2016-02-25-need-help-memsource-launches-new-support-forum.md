**Memsource has launched a new community and e-mail Support Center.** The existing [Memsource Community Support](http://support.memsource.com/) forum will continue to exist and be used as a knowledge base, but all new traffic will be redirected to the new Support Center.

<!--more-->

Compared to the previous platform, the new Support Center &#8211; which includes now all relevant articles and data &#8211; will provide **additional** **benefits**.

&#8211;          Users can choose whether to **post a public question** &#8211; perhaps when seeking some best-practice advice &#8211; or **send a private e-mail** to the Memsource support desk.

&#8211;          All new posts and articles will be classified under **five** **categories**:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  o   <strong>General:</strong> Information and answers to general questions (e.g. how you can pay for Memsource).
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  o   <strong>Tutorials:</strong> Getting started guides for project managers and linguist users, and other user documentation.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  o   <strong>Memsource Cloud:</strong> Articles dealing with issues related to the Memsource Cloud platform.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  o   <strong>Memsource Editor: </strong>Articles on issues related to Memsource Editor, both the desktop and web-based versions.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  o   <strong>Memsource API</strong>: Tips and tricks as well as troubleshooting information.
</p>

&#8211;          Before users post a question, the system will suggest solutions.

An example: If you want to ask how to upgrade to another edition of Memsource Cloud&#8230;

&nbsp;

&#8230; you will be directed to a list of articles or FAQs to help you find the right information.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&#8211;          The new support forum also provides **statistics and analytics.** This will allow the Support Team to better understand what kind of information Memsource users look for and improve it.

The new Support Center will give users a better experience, as all instructions, guidance and best practices will be within an even easier reach.
