The Yappn machine translation engine has been added to the list of supported MT engines available in Memsource.

In order to configure it, similarly to all the other engines, you would need to register with Yappn on their [official site](https://yappn.com)Â to gain access to all the necessary credentials.

Once your account has been created, you can insert your credentials into your Memsource account to make Yappn engine available for your projects.
