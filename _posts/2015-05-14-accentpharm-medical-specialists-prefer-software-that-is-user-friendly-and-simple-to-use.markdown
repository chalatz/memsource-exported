The following customer testimonial was provided by Oleg Titov, the director at AccentPharm Medical Translations.

[![](/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/olegtitovjpg.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/olegtitovjpg.jpg)"I believe Memsource has what it takes to win a significant portion of the market. I like the program because it is very accessible and easy for the translator. At our company most translations are done by medical specialists.<!-- more --> Often they aren't advanced IT users and prefer software that is user-friendly and simple to use. On our part we as the project management team are always sure that the translators are always using our translation memory and the term bases, since they don't need to Â set up or import anything".
