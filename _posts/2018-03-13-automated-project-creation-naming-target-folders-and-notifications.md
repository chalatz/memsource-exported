<span style="font-weight: 400;">Memsource users can now specify the name and destination of target folders (within the source folder) that are created when translations are done in Memsource via Automated Project Creation (APC).</span><!--more-->

<a class="dt-pswp-item" href="https://www.memsource.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/APC-Settings-Targetsubfolderpath-1.png" data-dt-img-description="" data-large\_image\_width="564" data-large\_image\_height="734"><img class=" wp-image-22669 alignright" src="https://www.memsource.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/APC-Settings-Targetsubfolderpath-1.png" alt="" width="417" height="543" /></a>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The new <strong>Target subfolder path</strong> field will only be visible in the <strong>Create Automated Project Settings</strong> when configuring APC with a supported connector. The following connectors are supported:</span> FTP, SFTP, Dropbox, Google Drive, Box, OneDrive, Git, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket Cloud.

See [this](https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003460931-How-to-setup-and-use-the-Automated-Project-Creation) article on Automated Project Creation in Memsource.

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, when a connector used as part of APC detects three or more instances in a row of a project not being created when it should be, an email notification will be sent to the affected Memsource users.</span>
