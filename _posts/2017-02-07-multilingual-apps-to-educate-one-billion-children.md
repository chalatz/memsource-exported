The UK-based non-profit organization <a href="https://onebillion.org/" target="_blank">onebillion</a> develops multilingual apps to spread numeracy and literacy among marginalized children throughout Africa and other regions.

Translating and localizing the apps presents a number of challenges for the developers, such as the quantity and type of target languages. As the app was deployed in more and more areas, it became clear that a smarter approach to managing the translations would be required.<!--more-->

**Learning math in 50 languages**
  
[<img class="alignleft wp-image-11862" src="http://www.memsource.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/onebillion-1.png" alt="onebillion-1" width="100" height="100" data-id="11862" />](http://www.memsource.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/onebillion-1.png)onebillion launched their math apps first and they are now available in more than 50 languages. The content for these apps consists mainly of short and simple instructions for the children to follow as they work on their exercises. Local translators, often non-professional, have so far been able to provide these translations.

**Next project: literacy apps**

The literacy app is a more complex project and only 3 language versions are currently available. Starting with the alphabet, it then moves to forming syllables, words, sentences, and finally short stories. For the localization of this type of material, onebillion collaborates closely with professionals working at local universities as well as UK based academic institutions.

**Time for a new approach to translation**
  
Until recently, onebillion was relying on an in-house translation system, which was perfectly adequate for the numeracy app. However, for the literacy app, it was clear that a centralization of their database and an advanced translation management tool would be crucial. Et voila! Memsource presented some key features that will assist with these challenges.
