Version 1.98 has been deployed to Memsource Cloud.
These are some of the new features and bug fixes:<!-- more -->



	
  * Translation memory and machine translation matches can be converted into actual discounts, using a user-defined [translation discount scheme](http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/Translation_Discount_Scheme) - a pretty cool feature

	
  * Several improvements of the subscription process to Memsource Cloud, most notably invoices get generated automatically now

	
  * When [exporting a term base into a CSV file format](http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/MemSource_Cloud_User_Manual#Export_CSV), a character set can be selected by the user

	
  * An [Edit button](http://wiki.memsource.com/wiki/MemSource_Cloud_User_Manual#Edit) has been added to projects, which allows editing multiple jobs at once

	
  * The number of tags has been dramatically decreased in some specific cases (this endeavor will continue!)

	
  * Issues with downloading files in some versions of the Safari web browser have been fixed

	
  * The **Email** button has been moved and is now located under the **Download** button; screenshot below:
