The Subscription page has gone through a major redesign in order to provider better and more streamlined user experience while retaining all the previous functions.

In **Setup** you can now find **Details** button in the **Subscription **section. This will lead you to the overview of your subscription as well as options to:



 	
  * Upgrade edition

 	
  * Add users

 	
  * Extend subscription


The section will also contain the information on the remaining subscription period, chosen Project Storage time and your past Invoices.[![](http://www.memsource.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/New-Subscription-page.png)](http://www.memsource.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/New-Subscription-page.png)
